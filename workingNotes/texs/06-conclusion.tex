\begin{section}{Conclusion}

Our experiments show that an ensemble of clusters can be a robust way to diversify results.
Unfortunately our re-rank method did not work in the test set as well as it did in the development set.
Last, the use of credibility also seem to have overfitted in development data, not being effective for the development set.
