This paper describes the efforts of Vienna University of Technology in the MediaEval 2014 Retrieving Diverse Social Images challenge.
Our approach consisted on 3 steps: a pre-filtering based on Machine Learning, a re-ranking based on Word2Vec and a clustering part based on a ensemble of clusters. 
Our best run reached a F@20 of 0.564.
