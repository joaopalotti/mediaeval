This paper describes the efforts of Vienna University of Technology (TUW) in the MediaEval 2014 Retrieving Diverse Social Images challenge.
Our approach consisted of 3 steps: (1) a pre-filtering based on Machine Learning, (2) a re-ranking based on Word2Vec, and (3) a clustering part based on a ensemble of clusters. 
Our best run reached a F@20 of 0.564.
