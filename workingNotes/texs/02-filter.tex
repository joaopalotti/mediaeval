\begin{subsection}{Pre-Filtering}

We employed a pre-filtering step to filter out potential irrelevant pictures.
For the 2014 development set, we calculated that 70\% (6256) are relevant images, while 30\% (2667) were not.
The goal of this step is to increase the percentage of relevant images. 
After applying a Logistic Regression classifier trained on the 2013 data, we could reach 74\% (5780) of relevant images, and 26\% (2026) of non-relevant images - removing a total of 1117 images. As features, we used the distance between images and POIs, number of views, length of descriptions and titles, images' license, part of the day (morning, afternoon, night) and the number of times the POI was used in the title and descriptions.
