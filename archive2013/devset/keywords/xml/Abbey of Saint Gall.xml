O'Donnell abú!&lt;/i&gt; The Gallowglass name is the anglicised form of the Irish words &lt;i&gt;Gall Óglach&lt;/i&gt; meaning “Foreign Young Hero” In contemporary Irish the word &lt;i&gt;óglach&lt;/i&gt; is still in use and is usually translated as volunteer but there is nothing voluntary inherent to the Irish words. In fact they were paid mercenaries from Western Scotland and offered their services to the highest bidders. The traditional view is that they were enlisted by the Gaelic lords of Ireland to help resist the arriving Normans. The appearance of these warriors on a Norman tomb indicates that it was far more likely that it was the Normans who enlisted their help against the native Irish. The Scots and Irish are both Gael and it is hard to imagine how they could be used against each other. This is mostly because we have a twisted view of history since the Nationalist Era (19th and early 20th centuries). The Gaelic tribes of Scotland had no real affinity with the Gaelic tribes of Ireland and vice versa. Worse still, the Gaelic clans of Scotland had no common link to the other Gaelic clans of Scotland and the Irish weren't that fond of each other either!! In Mel Gibson’s version of Braveheart he applies nationalist romanticism in one of his battle scenes. Edward IV of England enlisted Irish mercenaries and Gibson has them changing sides in an epic of never-existent, romantic brotherhood. His representation of the Battle of Stirling Bridge is an epic for die-hard nationalists in Scotland and in Ireland. The fact that it was merely a skirmish at Stirling Bridge is overlooked. There isn't even a bridge in the movie. Art is allowed to use imagination; we simply shouldn’t believe them to be literal. Leonardo da Vinci omitted any women from his painting of the Lord’s Supper. The fact that it was a Passover meal was not foremost in his mind. The Passover was the one ritual meal where men and women ate together – da Vinci wasn’t painting a Gospel scene, he was painting a mural at the end of a refectory and reputedly did it as a continuation of the actual dining tables. I digress! The fact that there was no affinity between the Irish and Scots in the 12th century should not really come as a surprise. The use of divide and conquer (long associated with the British Empire) has been used far longer than we often admit. Romans, Saxons, Celts, Normans and Greeks all exploited local divisions to affect their own progress. It made sense. It was a lot cheaper to raise an army of local rivals than to march a full army into another person’s territory. &lt;b&gt;Bonnaughts&lt;/b&gt; are also mentioned in the song O’Donnell Abú. A bonnaught is a soldier that was paid lodgings and keep for his military service. From the references in most old texts the bonnaught referred to a tribute or payment to soldiers and appears to derive from the word &lt;i&gt;bonn&lt;/i&gt; meaning a coin. The best translation would appear to be &lt;i&gt;mercenary&lt;/i&gt; Mercenaries and hirelings throng from the mountain passes - now there's an interesting lyric for nationalists!" id="4914949671" latitude="53.626779" license="1" longitude="-8.195652" nbComments="3" rank="1" tags="dominican ruins ireland roscommon saint marys mary norman church catholic architecture gall irishdominicans irishpriories dominicanprioriesinireland historyoftheirishdominicans dominicanhouses theirishdominicans gallowglass bonaught nationalismirish scots mercenary mercenaries" title="GALL ÓGLAIGH (Gallowglass)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4095/4914949671_3032099857_b.jpg" username="Fergal Mac Eoinin" views="995" />

These are as follows: fr. Patrick Backahan (Bacon) O.P. fr. Thomas Fitzsimons, O.P. Bishop Michael MacDonagh, O.P. fr. Edmund Magaheran, O.P. fr. Bernard MacHenry, O.P. fr. Thomas Fitzsimons, O.P. fr. Patrick Sheridan O.P. fr. Richard Nugent, O.P. Bishop Laurence Richardson, O.P. fr. John Reilly, O.P. fr. John O’Neill, O.P. fr. Andrew Smith, O.P. fr. Dominic McKiernan, O.P. fr. Bernard Brady, O.P. fr. Patrick Kiernan, O.P. fr. Andrew Smith, O.P. fr. Patrick Smith, O.P. fr. Anthony Foy, O.P. fr. James O’Reilly, O.P. fr. Rock McCabe, O.P. fr. Dominic Brullaughan, O.P. fr. Patrick Brullaughan, O.P. In 1681 Archbishop Oliver Plunkett makes no mention of Dominican foundations in the diocese of Kilmore. His memoirs list the presence of the friars throughout the province of Armagh (Ulster) and he remarks that the only community of mendicants in the entire diocese of Kilmore was the Franciscan Friary in Cavan town. In 1699 Father Patrick Backahan (Bacon) O.P., was made parish priest of Drumlane In 1714 Father Thomas Fitzsimons, O.P., was made parish priest of Drumlane In 1720, at the Chapter, the Provincial of the Irish Dominicans was ordered to appoint priors to the &lt;i&gt;”destitute houses of &lt;b&gt;Cavan&lt;/b&gt;, Clonmel, Castlelyons, Thomastown, Tulsk and Toombeola”&lt;/i&gt; - this indicates that some community existed and had existed for a undetermined time prior to 1720! In 1728 Michael MacDonagh, O.P., was appointed Bishop of Kilmore in 1728. In 1734 MacDonagh set about &lt;i&gt;re-establishing&lt;/i&gt; a Dominican community in his diocese. The area he chose was Drumlahane. This community was established and the brethren worked as parish clergy in the area around Belturbet. Local historians make reference to Fathers Edmund Magaheran, O.P., Bernard MacHenry, O.P., Thomas Fitzsimons, O.P., Patrick Sheridan O.P., and Patrick Bacon, O.P. These men functioned as parish priests in the parishes near the Augustinian Abbey of Drumlane. The dates of association begin in 1699 some thirty-five years before MacDonagh founded the community. Strangely enough, although some of these men were contemporaries of fr. John O’Heyne, he makes no reference to them in his book, &lt;i&gt;“The Irish Dominicans of the Seventeenth Century’&lt;/i&gt; which was first published in 1706. There is also a fr. Richard Nugent, O.P., included among those listed above, in MacHenry’s list of the community in 1734/5. In 1747 MacDonagh was succeeded as Bishop of Kilmore by Laurence Richardson, O.P. In 1750 one fr. John Reilly, O.P., of Lacken sold his family lands to the benefit of his convent in Cavan. In 1762 a certain fr. John O’Neill, O.P., of Cavan was accepted as a son of the Drogheda Dominicans. In 1764 the provincial, fr. Michael Hoare, O.P., complained about the defects of Sheridan and Fitzsimons of the Cavan community. In 1767 there was a young priest called fr. Andrew Smith, O.P., living in Cavan. That would be the bulk of the evidence of the Dominicans being in the area of Cavan. But we have no definitive answer to the questions of where they lived exactly or where they came to be in the area in the first place. &lt;b&gt;THE FUNNY THING ABOUT SURNAMES IN IRELAND&lt;/b&gt; Up to very recently most Irish people could be traced to their hometowns through their surnames. The growth of Dublin and other larger urban centres has disrupted this facility. MacDonagh is associated with Sligo (although also found in Kanturk and Clare), Richardson is associated with several areas as it was popular among the Normans, Magaheran is associated with south Donegal, MacHenry is associated with the border area of Tyrone and Derry Fitzsimons is associated with Westmeath, Sheridan is associated with Longford Bacon (sometimes called Backahan) is not listed as an Irish surname in Woulfe’s exhaustive &lt;i&gt;Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall&lt;/i&gt;. The interest in these names comes from the possibility that the friars in Cavan came from elsewhere indicating that they could have been members of another community or a collection of refugees from several adjoining communities in Eastern Connaught and Ulster. The nearest established foundation would be Gola Abbey which lies about twenty miles north of Belturbet. O’Heyne lists the names of thirteen members of that community that were known to him. None of these names appear in the Cavan list. There was a Father Fitzsimons attached to the Mullingar community in the late seventeenth century but little else is known of him. The friars at Longford were almost all called O’Farrell and those at Mullingar were mostly Dillon. Gola had a lot of Maguires so it is unlikely that this band of five men came from any of those communities. Looking west towards Sligo and you are in the traditional homelands of four of the five listed surnames. It is possible that these friars came from this side of the island. There is nothing to link the with Sligo or Roscommon specifically but; that region between Sligo and Roscommon housed five communities of which we know very little – Ballindoon was set in an area where the surnames MacDonagh, Magaheran, and MacHenry would have been present, Knockvicar, Clonshanville, Tulsk and Cloonameehan are not that far away. Richardson was to be found a few miles further to the west but should have been in the catchment area of Straide Abbey (The Abbey of Athlahan) or Urlar Abbey – it is possible that the brethren in Cavan came as fugitives from one (or all) of these communities. The absence of all of their names in O’Heyne is hard to understand. How could he have omitted fathers Bacon and Fitzsimons et al who were certainly his contemporaries? &lt;b&gt;WHERE DID THEY LIVE?&lt;/b&gt; Whilst it appears that the first Dominicans came from outside the region Daphne Pochin-Mould adds other names to the list of Dominicans associated with Cavan. Her names are of people, probably local, with surnames such as Kiernan, Smith and O’Reilly featuring in her list. Her list, from the end of the eighteenth century, includes a fr. Dominic McKiernan, O.P., as parish priest of Drumslane (not Drumlane) in the late 1790s. She also names frs. Bernard Brady, O.P., Patrick Kiernan, O.P., Andrew Smith, O.P., Patrick Smith, O.P., Anthony Foy, O.P., James O’Reilly, O.P., and, the parish priest of the Naul in north Dublin, fr. Rock McCabe, O.P., who died in 1820 but was known as the &lt;i&gt;Prior of Cavan&lt;/i&gt;. Fr. Hugh Fenning identifies a fr. Dominic Brullaughan, O.P., (whose name originates from mid-Ulster) who was active in the Cavan area in 1734 when elected prior of Holy Cross, Louvain. His nephew Patrick Brullaughan, O.P., was also a Dominican. The lists of names Pochin-Mould gives are certainly the surnames of Cavan families. This indicates that local men were joining the Dominicans but there is still absolutely nothing yet to support the idea that there was a priory, ancient or otherwise, in the area. We are presented with plenty of evidence of Dominicans being in the county of Cavan throughout the eighteenth century and evidence of several Dominicans proceeding from the area but there isn’t a hint or stock to indicate the location of a formal foundation. A visit to Cavan town was enough to put the &lt;i&gt;caip bháis&lt;/i&gt; (kybosh) on any claim that the Dominicans were ever present in that town. The local abbey was certainly Franciscan and local historians had never even heard of a Dominican claim. The strongest evidence of the presence of Dominicans is to be found in the present parish of Drumlane and more specifically at the church of Saint Patrick in Milltown. Local history linked the Dominicans to the almost neighbouring parishes of Drumlane and Kinawley. The brothers were working as rural pastors rather than as regular clergy. The simple idea that the two Dominican bishops drafted in their brethren from nearby priories is the most logical explanation but it leaves two gaps; ONE: there were Dominicans working in the area prior to the appointment of the bishops TWO: there is a list of Cavan friars separate to the local list and this list is compiled of traditional Cavan surnames indicating some stability of presence in the area. Add the fact that MacDonagh believed that he was &lt;i&gt;re-establishing&lt;/i&gt; a community and the confusion remains. Certainly the Franciscans objected to the foundation of a Dominican priory in the region and the secular clergy opposed the transfer of parishes to the Dominicans and we get a clear enough indication that MacDonagh was incorrect about there ever being an ancient foundation. Probably the most credible scenario would be something like this; friars from one of the neighbouring communities became active in the area during the persecutions of the seventeenth century. A few of them seem to have been in the Belturbet/Drumlane area and possibly even lived in a house of refuge prior to 1720, When the religious orders began to creep back in the early eighteenth century, an effort was made by the Dominican Bishop of Kilmore to establish this community formally. The Franciscans and clergy of Cavan objected and some un-formalised community was established in the parish of Drumlane. In an area that is now called Milltown, the Dominicans had a small hut which was built up as a proper church and now stands dedicated to the patronage of Saint Patrick." id="6162261886" latitude="54.062511" license="1" longitude="-7.491817" nbComments="0" rank="2" tags="dominican dominicans cavan belturbet milltown ireland kilmore bishop history" title="MILLTOWN - The Dominicans in Cavan" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6167/6162261886_d6c7765563_b.jpg" username="Fergal Mac Eoinin" views="498" />
