<photo  date_taken="2012-11-10 11:09:02" description="The palace has a rectangular plan, measuring 247 x 184 m. The four sides are connected by two orthogonal arms, forming four inner courts, each measuring more than 3,800 m2 (40,903 sq ft). Of all the Royal Palace in the World, Caserta Palace is by far the largest in term of volume, with more than 2 million m³ (70 million cu ft)[4] Behind the facades of its matching segmental ranges of outbuildings that flank the giant forecourt, a jumble of buildings arose to facilitate daily business. In the left hand arc was built as barracks. Here, later, during World War II the soldiers of the US Fifth Army recovered in a &amp;quot;rest centre&amp;quot;. From 1923 to 1943 the palace was the location of the Accademia Aeronautica, the Italian Air Force Academy. Of all the royal residences inspired by the Palace of Versailles, the Reggia of Caserta is the one that bears the greatest resemblance to the original model: the unbroken balustraded skyline, the slight break provided by pavilions within the long, somewhat monotonous facade. As at Versailles, a large aqueduct was required to bring water for the prodigious water displays. Like its French predecessor, the palace was intended to display the power and grandeur of an absolute Bourbon monarchy. A solecism at Caserta is that above the piano reale, the King's floor, is another floor of equal magnificence. The enfilades of Late Baroque saloni were the heart and seat of government, as well as displays of national wealth. Caserta provided a royal refuge from the dust and factions of the capital, just as Versailles had freed Louis XIV from Paris. The royal palace has more than 40 monumental rooms completely decorated with frescoes (for example, Versailles only counts 22 monumental rooms with frescoes). The inland location was more defensible than the old Royal Palace in Naples, which fronted the Bay of Naples and hence was vulnerable to attack from the sea. To provide the King with suitable protection, troop barracks were housed within the palace. The wide central entrance carriageway has, today, been incorporated into the city's automobile circulation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Caserta&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Caserta&lt;/a&gt;" id="8191002835" latitude="41.073136" license="1" longitude="14.327188" nbComments="1" rank="3" tags="caserta parco reggia park campania italy" title="Palace of Caserta - ND0_3774" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8201/8191002835_3808c73db1_b.jpg" username="Nicola since 1972" views="98" />
<photo  date_taken="2007-05-23 11:50:33" description="Caserta (the Palace of Caserta) (Italy) May 2007 Il progetto presentato da Vanvitelli in sedici tavole incise su rame non comprende solo la Reggia e le sue dipendenze, ma traccia la pianta e la fisionomia della nuova città che doveva sorgerle accanto, segna le strade di collegamento con i paesi vicini e, soprattutto, traccia la spina dorsale del progetto, il Gran Viale tra Napoli e la grande Cascata che sgorga dalla collina di Briano, a voler collegare idealmente la nuova capitale con la metropoli lontana passando per il Palazzo Reale, punto di riferimento e unità di misura di una composizione senza confini, su cui esso domina con la sua mole squadrata e la sua imponenza volumetrica; il Palazzo è collegato idealmente a Napoli dal nastro bianco che si stacca dalla Cascata e sembra segnare il percorso d'acqua per raggiungere la capitale. Il Viale doveva essere costeggiato da ruscelli, derivazioni dell'acquedotto carolino, ma non fu mai realizzato. The plan presented by Vanvitelli on sixteen tables engraved on copper does not only include the Royal Palace and its dependencies, but outlines the plan and physiognomy of the new city which was supposed to rise beside it. It marks the streets connecting the nearby villages, and traces the backbone of the the project, (p.17 Guida 060) the Gran Viale between Naples and the great waterfall that gushes from the hillside of Briano, intending to make an virtual connection between the new capital and the far away metropolis. The road was to pass through the Royal Palace, the point of reference and unit of measure for a composition without confines, it being dominated by the building's squared bulk and volumetric grandeur. The Palace was linked symbolically to Naples by the white ribbon which starts from the waterfall and seems to mark the route taken by the water to reach the capital. The Viale was supposed to be skirted by streams, derived from the Caroline aqueduct, but this was never realised.

<photo  date_taken="2008-04-09 14:02:32" description="Royal Palace of Caserta (Reggia di Caserta) : Exterior View The Royal Palace of Caserta is a former royal residence in Caserta, southern Italy, constructed for the Bourbon kings of Naples. It was the largest palace and one of the largest buildings erected in Europe during the eighteenth century. In 1997, the Palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, described in its nomination as &amp;quot;the swan song of the spectacular art of the Baroque, from which it adopted all the features needed to create the illusions of multidirectional space&amp;quot;. The construction of the palace was begun in 1752 for Charles VII of Naples, who worked closely with his architect Luigi Vanvitelli. When Charles saw Vanvitelli's grandly-scaled model for Caserta it filled him with emotion &amp;quot;fit to tear his heart from his breast&amp;quot;.

The Royal Palace of Madrid, where Charles had grown up, which had been devised by Filippo Juvarra for Charles' father, Philip V of Spain, and Charlottenburg Palace provided models. A spacious octagonal vestibule seems to have been inspired by Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in Venice, while the palatine chapel is most often compared to Robert de Cotte's royal chapel at Versailles. The king's primary object was to have a magnificent new royal court and administrative centre for the Kingdom in a location protected from sea attack. Vanvitelli died in 1773: the construction was continued by his son Carlo and finished in 1780. The palace has some 1,200 rooms, including two dozen state apartments, a large library, and a theatre modelled after the Teatro San Carlo of Naples. The population of Caserta Vecchia was moved 10 kilometers to provide a work force closer to the palace. A silk manufactory at San Leucio resort was disguised as a pavilion in the immense parkland. A monumental avenue that would run 20 kilometers between the Palace and Naples was planned but never realized. In April 1945 the palace was the site of the signing of terms of the unconditional German surrender of forces in Italy. The agreement covered between 600,000 and 900,000 soldiers along the Italian Front including troops in sections of Austria. The palace has a rectangular plan, measuring 247 x 184 m. The four sides are connected by two orthogonal arms, forming four inner courts, each measuring more than 3,800 m². Behind the facades of its matching segmental ranges of outbuildings that flank the giant forecourt, a jumble of buildings arose to facilitate daily business.

To provide the King with suitable protection, troop barracks were housed within the palace. The wide central entrance carriageway has, today, been incorporated into the city's automobile circulation. The garden, a typical example of the baroque extension of formal vistas, stretch for 120 ha, partly on hilly terrain. It is inspired by the park of Versailles, but it is commonly regarded as superior in beauty. The park starts from the back façade of the palace, flanking a long alley with artificial fountains and cascades. There is an English garden in the upper part designed in the 1780s by Carlo Vanvitelli and the London-trained plantsman-designer John Graefer, recommended to Sir William Hamilton by Sir Joseph Banks. It is an early Continental example of an &amp;quot;English garden&amp;quot; in the svelte naturalistic taste of Capability Brown. The fountains and cascades, each filling a vasca (&amp;quot;basin&amp;quot;), with architecture and hydraulics by Luigi Vanvitelli at intervals along a wide straight canal that runs to the horizon, rivalled those at Peterhof outside St. Petersburg. These include: The Fountain of Diana and Actaeon (sculptures by Paolo Persico, Brunelli, Pietro Solari); The Fountain of Venus and Adonis (1770–80); The Fountain of the Dolphins (1773–80); The Fountain of Aeolus; The Fountain of Ceres. A large population of figures from classical Antiquity were modelled by Gaetano Salomone for the gardens of the Reggia, and executed by large workshops." id="5263827350" latitude="0" license="1" longitude="0" nbComments="24" rank="7" tags="caserta" title="PICT0056" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5201/5263827350_5d4c0a690c_b.jpg" username="Vincenzo Spina" views="300" />

It is one of the four residences used by the Bourbon Kings of Naples during their rule of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies (1730-1860): one is in Caserta, another on the Capodimonte hill overlooking Naples, and the third (now the site of the agricultural department of the University of Naples) is in Portici on the slopes of Vesuvius. The Royal Palace is on the site of an earlier building meant to host King Philip III of Spain, who however never made the trip. The architect chosen for that palace was Domenico Fontana. The building was put up on the site of an even older Spanish viceroyal residence from the early 16th century. The royal residence was moved to Caserta in the 18th century, as that inland town was more defensible from naval assault than Naples. The 17th century palace visible today is, however, the result of numerous additions and changes, including some by Luigi Vanvitelli in the mid-18th century and then by Gaetano Genovese in 1838 after a fire had damaged much of the palace. Additionally, restoration was done after World War II to repair bomb damage. The western façade side of the building (fronting on Piazza del Plebiscito) displays a series of statues of the rulers of dynasties to rule Naples since the foundation of the Kingdom of Naples in the twelfth century.

<photo  date_taken="2007-04-10 10:59:45" description="Naples,Campania (Italy)  The Royal Palace of Naples is one of four palaces that the Bourbon Kings of Naples used during their rule of the Kingdom of Naples (1730-1860): one is in Caserta, another on the Capodimonte hill overlooking Naples, and the third (now the site of the agricultural department of the University of Naples) is in Portici on the slopes of Vesuvius.  The Royal Palace is on the site of an earlier building meant to host King Philip III of Spain, who however never made the trip. The architect chosen for that palace was Domenico Fontana. The building was put up on the site of an even older Spanish viceroyal residence from the early 16th century. The royal residence was moved to Caserta in the 18th century, as that inland town was more defensible from naval assault than Naples.  The 17th century palace visible today is, however, the result of numerous additions and changes, including some by Luigi Vanvitelli in the mid-18th century and then by Gaetano Genovese in 1838 after a fire had damaged much of the palace. Additionally, restoration was done after World War II to repair bomb damage. The western façade side of the building (fronting on Piazza del Plebiscito) displays a series of statues of the rulers of dynasties to rule Naples since the foundation of the Kingdom of Naples in the twelfth century. They are: Roger II, Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, Charles of Anjou, Alfonse of Aragon, Emperor Charles V, Charles III of Bourbon, Joachim Murat, and Victor Emanuel II of Savoy, the first king of united Italy.  Today the palace and adjacent grounds house the San Carlo Theater, a museum, the National Library of Naples and a number of city offices, including those of the regional tourist board.  (font: Wikipedia)" id="454534029" latitude="41.004775" license="4" longitude="14.172363" nbComments="1" rank="145" tags="naples campania italy" title="The Royal Palace - Naples" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/207/454534029_5d5c2fd6f5_b.jpg" username="Chiara Marra" views="655" />
