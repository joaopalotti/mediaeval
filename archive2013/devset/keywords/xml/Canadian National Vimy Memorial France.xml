<photo  date_taken="2012-07-01 09:01:05" description="--English below-- C'est sur le territoire de la commune voisine de Givenchy-en-Gohelle que se trouve le mémorial de Vimy, le plus important monument canadien aux victimes de la Première Guerre mondiale. Le monument s'élève au sommet de la cote 145 pour laquelle se sont battus les soldats canadiens en avril 1917. Il rend hommage au rôle des Canadiens lors de ce conflit, au moyen de figures de pierre symbolisant les valeurs défendues et les sacrifices faits. Érigée entre 1925 et 1936 sur le site de la bataille de la crête de Vimy, cette œuvre d'art est le fruit du travail d'artistes canadiens. Les deux pylônes, représentant le Canada et la France, culminent 40 mètres au-dessus de la base du monument. En raison de l'altitude du site, la figure le plus élevée - l'allégorie de la paix - domine la plaine de Lens d'environ 110 mètres. Le terrain d'assise du mémorial ainsi que la centaine d'hectares qui l'entoure ont été donnés au peuple canadien par la France en 1922. Cela en signe de gratitude pour les sacrifices faits par plus de 66 000 Canadiens au cours de la Grande Guerre et notamment pour la victoire remportée par les troupes canadiennes en conquérant la crête de Vimy au cours du mois d'avril 1917. En s'avançant à l'avant du monument, on peut remarquer une statue de femme voilée, tournée vers l'est, vers l'aube d'un nouveau jour. Elle représente le Canada, une jeune nation, pleurant ses fils tombés au combat. L'arête de Vimy est aujourd'hui boisée, chaque arbre a été planté par un Canadien et symbolise le sacrifice d'un soldat. Les pierres calcaires choisies par Walter Allward viennent de Croatie. Elles sont montées sur une structure en béton. Les pierres d'origine s'étant abîmées avec le temps, des travaux de restauration ont été entrepris en 2005 et se sont achevés en 2007. La reine Élisabeth II a participé à l'inauguration le 7 avril 2007. --English- &lt;i&gt;The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is a memorial site in France dedicated to the memory of Canadian Expeditionary Force members killed during the First World War. It also serves as the place of commemoration for First World War Canadian soldiers killed or presumed dead in France who have no known grave. The monument is the centrepiece of a 250-acre (100 ha) preserved battlefield park that encompasses a portion of the grounds over which the Canadian Corps made their assault during the Battle of Vimy Ridge, a military engagement fought as part of the Battle of Arras. The Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first occasion whereupon all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, and thus became a Canadian nationalistic symbol of achievement and sacrifice. France ceded to Canada perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge under the understanding that the Canadians use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, trenches, craters and unexploded munitions still honeycomb the grounds of the site, which remains largely closed off for public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, there are a number of other memorials and cemeteries contained within the site. The memorial took monument designer Walter Seymour Allward eleven years to build. King Edward VIII unveiled the memorial on 26 July 1936, in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun, 50,000 or more Canadian and French veterans, and their families. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen Elizabeth II rededicated the memorial on 9 April 2007 during a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. The memorial site is one of two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside of Canada and is maintained by Veterans Affairs Canada.&lt;/i&gt; source Wikipedia" id="7513131722" latitude="50.379767" license="4" longitude="2.773833" nbComments="2" rank="6" tags="olibac vimy mémorial memorial wwi premièreguerremondiale canada canoneos500d mmxii" title="Vimy" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8016/7513131722_31e16c4880_b.jpg" username="OliBac" views="193" />

The main combatants were the Canadian Corps against three divisions of the German Sixth Army. The battle, which took place from 9 April to 12 April 1917, was part of the opening phase of the British-led Battle of Arras, a diversionary attack for the French Nivelle Offensive. The objective of the Canadian Corps was to take control of the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The town of Thélus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest of the ridge once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient of considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll located outside the town of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line. Historians attribute the success of the Canadian Corps in capturing the ridge to a mixture of technical and tactical innovation, meticulous planning, powerful artillery support, and extensive training, as well as the failure of the German Sixth Army to properly apply the German defensive doctrine. The battle was the first occasion when all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle together, and thus became a Canadian nationalistic symbol of achievement and sacrifice.

The central figure is of a woman, representing Canada, the look of anguish on her face almost too much to bear. &amp;quot;Canada's most impressive tribute overseas to those Canadians who fought and gave their lives in the First World War is the majestic and inspiring Canadian National Vimy Memorial which overlooks the Douai Plain from the highest point of Vimy Ridge, about eight kilometres northeast of Arras. The Memorial does more than mark the site of the engagement that Canadians were to remember with more pride than any other operation of the First World War. It stands as a tribute to all who served their country in battle in that four-year struggle and particularly to those who gave their lives. At the base of the Memorial, these words appear in French and in English: &lt;b&gt;To the valour of their Countrymen in the Great War And in memory of their sixty Thousand dead this monument Is raised by the people of Canada&lt;/b&gt; Inscribed on the ramparts of the Memorial are the names of 11,285 Canadian soldiers who were posted as &amp;quot;missing, presumed dead&amp;quot; in France.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/Vimy&amp;amp;CFID=19523948&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=74689204&quot;&gt;(Taken from the Veteran Affairs Canada Website)&lt;/a&gt; Designed by the Canadian Architect and Sculptor Walter Seymour Allward, it took 11 years to build and stands on a bed of 11000 tons of Concrete!

The sarcophagus is patterned after the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in Vimy, France. British Columbia sculptor Mary Anne Liu carved the bronze elements.

<photo  date_taken="1917-01-01 00:00:00" description="Nothing on reverse but the title is derived from an identical photograph in my collection. &amp;quot;Tank in the Siegfried Line to the left of Riencourt before Bullecourt&amp;quot;. The original Siegfried line (German: Siegfriedstellung) was a line of defensive forts and tank defences built by Germany as a section of the Hindenburg Line 1916–1917 in northern France during World War I. Bullecourt was the first Australian attack on the Hindenburg Line in April 1917. This action was part of a wider British offensive, known as the Battle of Arras, which began the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps between 9 and 12 April. At Bullecourt the Australian infantry attack was to be led by twelve British tanks in place of the usual preliminary bombardment to cut the enemy’s barbed wire defences. The assault was timed for 4.30 am on 10 April 1917 but, due to the non-arrival of the tanks, was postponed for 24 hours. The next day, 11 April 1917, the 4th and 12th Brigade 1of the 4th Australian Division were back in position east of the village of Bullecourt. By 4.30 am, however, only three tanks had taken their positions in front of the 4th Brigade and none had reached the 12th Brigade. The 4th Brigade advanced but the 12th Brigade waited for their tanks before advancing at 5.15 am. These early tanks were slower than a walking man and their steel was thin. Accurate shooting by the German artillery meant none reached the wire before the infantry and only one tank reached the German trenches at all. Both the German front line and support trenches were captured, but the Australians were held up as they advanced towards Riencourt village, and all the tanks were knocked out by 7 am. Seeing German troops in motion at Riencourt, Lieutenant Colonel ‘Harry’ Murray fired the SOS signal for artillery support. The signal was repeated seventeen times during the morning, but there was no answering barrage. This was due to exaggerated reports of Australian success, mainly from the air and artillery observers, causing headquarters staff in the rear to believe that the advance was proceeding. Consequently, the guns were not allowed to fire. German machine guns freely swept the open ground, not only in front but also to the rear of the Australians. As the morning wore on, the Australian position worsened. Grenades ran out and the attempt to link the trenches held by the 4th and 12th Brigades was abandoned. Gradually the Germans drove the Australians back, and at 11.30 am it was clear that the position could not be held. With German fire sweeping the escape route, Harry Murray told his men, ‘It is either capture or go into that’. Many tried, but Murray was among the few who returned. At 12.30 pm, the last of the Australians withdrew, helped by the artillery, which had finally been allowed to fire in support. The 48th Battalion (South Australia and Western Australia) troops in the Hindenburg Line were commanded by Captain Allan Edwin Leane, a nephew of the unit’s Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Ray Leane. Many of this battalion’s leaders were from his family, and it became known as the ‘Joan of Arc’ Battalion (‘Made of all Leanes’ 2). Captain Allen Leane went missing near the wire and Private John Robert Knight later reported that he saw Leane dead in a shell hole with a bullet in his head. Leane’s body was never recovered and he is commemorated at the Australian National Memorial, Villers-Bretonneux. The losses of the 4th Brigade on 11 April 1917 were the heaviest ever suffered in any one action by an Australian brigade: 2,339 casualties out of 3,000 men engaged. The 12th Brigade losses were 950. For more than a year afterwards few Australian soldiers had any faith in tanks.

<photo  date_taken="2012-02-02 08:38:05" description="The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is a memorial site in France dedicated to the memory of Canadian Expeditionary Force members killed during the First World War. It also serves as the place of commemoration for First World War Canadian soldiers killed or presumed dead in France who have no known grave. The monument is the centrepiece of a 250-acre (100 ha) preserved battlefield park that encompasses a portion of the grounds over which the Canadian Corps made their assault during the Battle of Vimy Ridge, a military engagement fought as part of the Battle of Arras. The Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first occasion whereupon all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, and thus became a Canadian nationalistic symbol of achievement and sacrifice. In recognition of Canada's war efforts, France granted Canada perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge under the understanding that the Canadians use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, trenches, craters and unexploded munitions still honeycomb the grounds of the site, which remains largely closed off for public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, there are a number of other memorials and cemeteries contained within the site. The memorial took monument designer Walter Seymour Allward eleven years to build. King Edward VIII unveiled the memorial on 26 July 1936, in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun, 50,000 or more Canadian and French veterans, and their families. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen Elizabeth II rededicated the memorial on 9 April 2007 during a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. The memorial site is one of two Canadian National Historic Sites located outside of Canada and is maintained by Veterans Affairs Canada." id="6799796904" latitude="0" license="5" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="33" tags="vimy france canada worldwar1 ww1 wwi premièreguerremondiale arras" title="Canadian National Vimy Memorial" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7188/6799796904_b5e8c7135a_b.jpg" username="©HTO3" views="107" />

<photo  date_taken="2007-11-11 00:00:37" description="Vimy Ridge memorial sculpture. The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a military engagement fought as part of the Battle of Arras, in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France, during the First World War. The main combatants were the Canadian Corps against three divisions of the German Sixth Army. The battle, which took place from 9 April to 12 April 1917, was part of the opening phase of the British-led Battle of Arras, a diversionary attack for the French Nivelle Offensive. The objective of the Canadian Corps was to take control of the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The town of Thélus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest of the ridge once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient of considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll located outside the town of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line. Historians attribute the success of the Canadian Corps in capturing the ridge to a mixture of technical and tactical innovation, meticulous planning, powerful artillery support, and extensive training, as well as the failure of the German Sixth Army to properly apply the German defensive doctrine. The battle was the first occasion when all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle together, and thus became a Canadian nationalistic symbol of achievement and sacrifice.
