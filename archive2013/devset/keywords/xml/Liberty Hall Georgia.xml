<photo  date_taken="2006-06-17 05:13:54" description="Juliette Gordon Low (October 31, 1860 – January 17, 1927) was an American youth leader and the founder of the Girl Scouts of the USA in 1912. She was born Juliette Magill Kinzie Gordon in Savannah, Georgia, and was known as &amp;quot;Daisy&amp;quot; for most of her life because when her uncle saw her as a baby girl, he said, &amp;quot;I'll bet she'll be a daisy!.&amp;quot; Her mother's family came from Chicago and her father was a Confederate Captain in the American Civil War. Daisy was also called &amp;quot;grasshopper&amp;quot;, because she would always be jumping into new games, hobbies and ideas. Another one of her nicknames was &amp;quot;Little Ship.&amp;quot; Her grandparents in the North called her that because she would always beg to hear the story about her great-grandmother, who was captured by Indians. Even though she was a captive, she was always joyful, so the Indians started calling her &amp;quot;Little-Ship-Under-Full-Sail.&amp;quot; Juliette was educated in several prominent boarding schools, including the Virginia Female Institute (now Stuart Hall School) and Mesdemoiselles Charbonniers (a French finishing school in New York City). When she was about 25 years old, Juliette suffered an ear infection which was treated with silver nitrate. This treatment damaged her ear, causing her to lose a great deal of her hearing in that ear. At the age of 26, even though her parents had apprehensions, she married William Mackay &amp;quot;Willy&amp;quot; Low, the son of a wealthy cotton merchant in Savannah and England. His mother was a native of Savannah, Georgia. Their wedding took place on December 21, 1886, which happened to be her parents' 29th wedding anniversary. A grain of rice thrown at the wedding became lodged in Juliette's good ear. When it was removed, her ear drum was punctured and became infected, causing her to become completely deaf in that ear. Her hearing was severely limited for the rest of her life. Her marriage to Mr. Low proved to be childless and unhappy. Although the couple moved to England, Juliette continued her travels and divided her time between the British Isles and America. During the Spanish-American War, Juliette came back to America to aid in the war effort. She helped her mother organize a convalescent hospital for wounded soldiers returning from Cuba. Her father was commissioned as a general in the U.S. Army and served on the Puerto Rican Peace Commission. As early as 1901, due to her husband's infidelities, Juliette intended to get a divorce. However, her husband died before the divorce proceedings could be finalized. When his will was read Juliette discovered that her husband had left his money to his mistress. She was left with a small widow's pension. It was in 1911 that Juliette met Second Boer War hero (and founder of the Scouting movement) Robert Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes. She and Sir (later Lord) Baden Powell shared a passion for sculpture and art. She also enjoyed working with iron. While in the UK, Juliette worked as a Girl Guide leader for troops she organized in Scotland and London. Juliette decided to found something similar for the girls of America. On March 12, 1912, Juliette gathered 18 girls to register the first troop of American Girl Guides. Margaret &amp;quot;Daisy Doots&amp;quot; Gordon, her niece and namesake, was the first registered member, but did not attend the first meeting. The name of the organization was changed to Girl Scouts the following year. The organization was incorporated in 1915, with Juliette serving as president until 1920 when she was granted the title of founder. In personality, Daisy was known for being eccentric and charming. One commonly related anecdote recounts how, at an early Scout board meeting, she stood on her head to display the new Girl Scout shoes that she happened to be wearing. She also wrote poems; sketched, wrote and acted in plays; and became a skilled painter and sculptor. She had many pets throughout her life and was particularly fond of exotic birds, Georgia mockingbirds, and dogs. Daisy was also known for her great sense of humor. Juliette Gordon Low contracted breast cancer in 1923, but kept it a secret and continued diligently working for the Girl Scouts. Low died January 17, 1927, from this cancer, and was buried in her Girl Scout uniform in Savannah, Georgia. In Savannah, Georgia tourists and locals can visit three historic sites which relate to the life of Juliette Gordon Low. The home of her birth, The Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace is one of the most visited house museums in Georgia. The Andrew Low House became her Savannah home after her marriage to William Mackay Low in 1886, and The Girl Scout First Headquarters is the former carriage house of the Andrew Low family. Juliette converted the carriage house into her Girl Scout headquarters shortly after the first meeting in 1912 and willed it to the local Savannah Girl Scouts upon her death in 1927. During World War II, a Liberty ship was named after her, the SS Juliette Low, hull number 2446. This ship was launched on May 12, 1944, and scrapped in 1972. On July 3, 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed a bill authorizing a stamp in honor of Juliette Gordon Low. The stamp was one of few dedicated to women. In 1953, Girl Scouts of the USA purchased and restored Juliette Low's childhood home in Savannah. It became known as the Juliette Gordon Low Girl Scout National Center, and is often referred to in Scouting as the Birthplace. In 1965, the house was designated a registered National Historic Landmark. In 1954, the city of Savannah, Georgia, honored her by naming a school after her. A Juliette Low School also exists in Anaheim, California. On October 28, 1979, Juliette Low was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York. On December 2, 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed a bill naming a new federal building in Savannah in honor of Juliette Low. It was the second federal building in history to be named after a woman. In 1992, a Georgia non-profit group honored Juliette Low as one of the first Georgia Women of Achievement. A bust of Juliette Low is displayed in the State Capitol. In 2000, The Deaf World in Wax, a traveling exhibit, featured Juliette Low as a famous deaf American. In 2005, Juliette Low was honored as part of a new national monument in Washington, D.C.named The Extra Mile Points of Light Volunteer Pathway. The monument's medallions, laid into sidewalks adjacent to the White House, form a one-mile walking path." id="168543246" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="1" rank="4" tags="" title="Juliette Gordon Low" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/59/168543246_925af8e36d_b.jpg" username="dbking" views="17284" />

<photo  date_taken="2005-08-20 15:26:36" description="When the seat of the federal government was transferred permanently to Washington, D.C., in 1800, no provision was made for housing for the Supreme Court. Less than two weeks before the Court was to convene, Congress resolved to let the Court use a room in the Capitol. The Court moved into the Old North Wing (image above), meeting in various rooms from February 1810 to December 1860. During the early years when construction displaced the Justices, they had to meet in nearby homes or taverns. Eventually the Court occupied a courtroom that had been especially designed for it in the basement beneath the new Senate chamber. When the Court moved upstairs in 1861, the old courtroom became the law library for both Congress and the Court, seen here in this c. 1895 photograph. The Supreme Court was housed in what is now called the restored Old Senate Chamber from 1861 to 1935. Although the chamber was more spacious and dignified than the basement one, there was no dining room (the Justices lunched in the robing room), and no individual office space for the Justices and their staff (the Justices often worked at home). Chief Justice William Howard Taft and the Associate Justices admired architect Cass Gilbert’s model for a new Supreme Court building in 1929. Taft had begun lobbying for a separate building as early as 1912, and redoubled his efforts when he became Chief Justice in 1921. Taft not only persuaded Congress to fund the nearly $10 million building, giving the Court its own home for the first time, but he also oversaw its planning and initial construction. When the cornerstone was laid in 1932, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes said of Taft, who had died two years before: “This building is the result of his intelligent persistence.” To a country sunk deep in the Great Depression, Chief Justice Hughes added: “The Republic endures and this is the symbol of its faith.” Gleaming bone white and austere among its distinguished neighbors on Capitol Hill, its stately façade evoking the long-enduring glory of ancient Rome, the Supreme Court Building imposes a mood of decorum. The aura of formality is no accident. When architect Cass Gilbert submitted his design in May, 1929, he planned “a building of dignity and importance suitable…for the permanent home of the Supreme Court of the United States.” Gilbert has been chosen by a commission led by Chief Justice William Howard Taft. Gilbert’s associates were Cass Gilbert, Jr., and John R. Rockart, with executive supervision by David Lynn, Architect of the Capitol. Into the Building the architects put about three million dollars’ worth of marble. For the exterior walls alone a thousand freight car loads of flawless stone come from Vermont—along with a 250-ton slab specifically cut for sculptor James E. Fraser’s allegorical figures at the entrance. Georgia marble was chosen for the outer walls of four courtyards that divide the building into a cross-shaped center core and a gallery of offices and corridors. Nearly square, the resulting structure is 92 feet high and stretches 385 feet on its longest side. The interior walls are faced with marble quarried in Alabama. Opposite the formal entrance, at the east end of the aptly named Great Hall, is the Court Chamber proper—82 by 91 feet, with a coffered ceiling 44 feet high. Gilbert walled this imposing room with Ivory Vein marble from Spain. For the 24 massive columns he insisted on marble of a particularly delicate tint, called light Siena, from the Old Convent quarry in the Italian province of Liguria. From Italy the rough stone went to a firm of marble finishers in Knoxville, Tennessee, who dressed and honed the blocks into 72 slightly tapered cylinders, 11 feet in circumference at the widest. Three sections went into each 30-foot column, to be topped by an Ionic capital. Darker marble from Italy and Africa gives color to the floor. Against the marble the room gains richness from its fittings: tones of red in carpet and upholstery and heavy draperies, highly polished luster in solid Honduras mahogany, gleaming bronze latticework in gates to the side corridors. And in 1973, new lighting, new paint, and new gilding restored the ornamented ceiling to a brilliance time had since dimmed since its installation nearly 40 years before. Like Taft, Gilbert did not live to see his dream building completed. He died in 1934. The Court held its first session in the new building on October 7, 1935. Not everyone liked the new building. Associate Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, who later became Chief Justice, at first called it “almost bombastically pretentious…wholly inappropriate for a quiet group of old boys such as the Supreme Court.” One of the old boys reportedly said that he and his brethren would be “nine black beetles in the Temple of Karnak.” Another—undoubtedly thinking of exotic pomp rather than domestic party symbols—remarked that the Justices ought to enter it riding on elephants. Such comments suggest how different men have regarded their own remarkable positions of power, prestige and responsibility in the life of the Nation. Off the bench their successors show a similar concern—how to maintain a sense of human perspective in the marble temple. The Supreme Court Building, constructed between 1932--1935, was designed by noted architect Cass Gilbert, who is best known as the architect for the Woolworth Building in New York. The first session of the Supreme Court was convened on February 1, 1790, but it took some 145 years for the Supreme Court to find a permanent residence. During those years the Supreme Court lived a nomadic existence. Initially meeting in the Royal Exchange Building in New York, the Court established chambers in Independence Hall and later in City Hall when the national capitol moved to Philadelphia in 1790. The Court moved again when the Federal government moved in 1800 to the permanent capital in Washington. Since no provision had been made for a Supreme Court building, Congress lent the Court space in the new Capitol building. The Court convened for a short period in a private home after the British had used Supreme Court documents to set fire to the Capitol during the War of 1812. Following this episode, the Court returned to the Capitol and met from 1819 to 1860 in a chamber that has been restored as the Old Supreme Court Chamber. Then from 1860 to 1935, the Court sat in what is now known as the Old Senate Chamber. Finally in 1929, former President William Howard Taft, who was Chief Justice from 1921 to 1930, persuaded Congress to end this arrangement and authorize a permanent home for the Court. At the laying of the cornerstone for the building on October 13, 1932, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes stated, &amp;quot;The Republic endures and this is the symbol of its faith.&amp;quot; The building was designed on a scale in keeping with the importance and dignity of the Court and the Judiciary as a coequal, independent branch of the Federal government and as a symbol of &amp;quot;the national ideal of justice in the highest sphere of activity.&amp;quot; Sixteen marble columns at the main west entrance support the portico and on the architrave above is incised, &amp;quot;Equal Justice Under the Law.&amp;quot; Capping the entrance is the pediment filled with a sculpture group by Robert Aitken, representing Liberty Enthroned Guarded by Order and Authority. Cast in bronze, the west entrance doors sculpted by John Donnelly, Jr., depict historic scenes in the development of the law. The east entrance's architrave bears the legend, &amp;quot;Justice the Guardian of Liberty.&amp;quot; A sculpture group by Herman A. McNeil is located above the east entrance that represents great lawgivers, Moses, Confucius, and Solon, flanked by symbolic groups representing Means of Enforcing the Law, Tempering Justice with Mercy, Carrying on Civilization, and Settlement of Disputes Between States. Some critics condemn the religious symbols in the marble frieze above the east entrance to the building. However, in the 1930s, the Supreme Court Building Commission did not question the sculptures. Rather, they trusted in the architect, who deferred to the artistry of the sculptor, Herman A. MacNeil. Explaining his work, MacNeil wrote, &amp;quot;Law as an element of civilization was normally and naturally derived or inherited in this country from former civilizations. The 'Eastern Pediment' of the Supreme Court Building suggests therefore the treatment of such fundamental laws and precepts as are derived from the East.&amp;quot; At the center of the pediment, the figures of Moses, Confucius and Solon represent three great civilizations. Flanking these figures are symbols which represent law enforcement and the tempering of justice with mercy. The presence of children suggests that civilization will continue through the learning of right and wrong. The two figures with shields on the left-hand side suggest that disputes between states will be settled through enlightened justice. On the right side are symbols of maritime and other large functions which protect the United States. At the corners of the pediment are symbols which represent the fable of the Tortoise and the Hare, study and the pondering of judgments, and the supremacy of the Court. The US Supreme Court Building was the last project of Cass Gilbert's career, and was a team effort by members of his firm. Gilbert died in 1934, one year before the Building was completed. •The Supreme Court building is 304 feet wide, 385 and long. •The exterior is Vermont marble. •The interior courtyard is Georgia marble. •The floors are partially Alabama marble. •The British used documents from the Supreme Court to burn the U.S. Capitol during the War of 1812. •28 October, 2001 - For the first time in 66 years, the Supreme Court is forced to meet outside of its chambers. This change is ordered after anthrax was discovered in the mail room. •17 June, 2003 - A five-year, US$122,000,000.00 renovation begins. The main entrance to the Supreme Court Building is on the west side, facing the United States Capitol. A few low steps lead up to the 252-foot-wide oval plaza in front of the building. Flanking these steps is a pair of marble candelabra with carved panels on their square bases depicting: Justice, holding sword and scales, and The Three Fates, weaving the thread of life. On either side of the plaza are fountains, flagpoles, and benches. The bronze flagpole bases are crested with symbolic designs of the scales and sword, the book, the mask and torch, the pen and mace, and the four elements: air, earth, fire, and water. On either side of the main steps are seated marble figures. These large statues are the work of sculptor James Earle Fraser. On the left is a female figure, the Contemplation of Justice. On the right is a male figure, the Guardian or Authority of Law. Sixteen marble columns at the main west entrance support the pediment. On the architrave above is incised .Equal Justice Under Law.. Capping the entrance is a sculptured group by Robert Aitken, representing Liberty Enthroned guarded by Order and Authority. On either side are groups of three figures depicting Council and Research which Aitken modelled after several prominent individuals concerned with the law or the creation of the Supreme Court Building. At the left are Chief Justice Taft as a youth, Secretary of State Elihu Root, and the architect Cass Gilbert. Seated on the right are Chief Justice Hughes, the sculptor Aitken, and Chief Justice Marshall as a young man. Too often, visitors do not see the corresponding pediment and columns on the east side. Here the sculpture group is by Hermon A. MacNeil, and the marble figures represent great lawgivers, Moses, Confucius, and Solon, flanked by symbolic groups representing Means of Enforcing the Law, Tempering Justice with Mercy, Settlement of Disputes Between States, and Maritime and other functions of the Supreme Court. The architrave bears the legend: .Justice the Guardian of Liberty.. One can enter the building through the opened bronze doors of the west front, each of which weighs six and one-half tons and slides into a wall recess when open. The door panels, sculpted by John Donnelly, Jr., depict historic scenes in the development of law: the trial scene from the shield of Achilles, as described in the Iliad; a Roman praetor publishing an edict; Julian and a pupil; Justinian publishing the Corpus Juris; King John sealing the Magna Carta; the Chancellor publishing the first Statute of Westminster; Lord Coke barring King James from sitting as a Judge; and Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story. The main corridor is known as the Great Hall. At each side, double rows of monolithic marble columns rise to a coffered ceiling. Busts of all former Chief Justices are set alternately in niches and on marble pedestals along the side walls. The frieze is decorated with medallion profiles of lawgivers and heraldic devices. At the east end of the Great Hall, oak doors open into the Court Chamber. This dignified room measures 82 by 91 feet and has a 44.foot ceiling. Its 24 columns are Old Convent Quarry Siena marble from Liguria, Italy; its walls and friezes are of Ivory Vein marble from Alicante, Spain; and its floor borders are Italian and African marble. The raised Bench behind which the Justices sit during sessions, and other furniture in the Courtroom are mahogany. The Bench was altered in 1972 from a straight-line to a .winged. shape to provide sight and sound advantages over the original design. At the left of the Bench is the Clerk of the Courts desk.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 and designated a Mississippi Landmark in 1986. The current Mississippi State Capitol building, often called the &amp;quot;New Capitol,&amp;quot; is located in downtown Jackson and has been the home to Mississippi's state legislature since 1903. It is the third capitol building in Jackson. The building was erected on the site of the old state penitentiary and was designed by Theodore Link, an architect from St. Louis, Missouri. The building cost $1,093,641 dollars, which was paid by the Illinois Central Railroad via back taxes they owed the state. The capitol is 402 feet (123 m) long and 180 feet (55 m) to the top of the dome. The exterior is made up of Georgia granite, foundation concrete walls and bedford limestone. The Beaux-Arts architecture style building was designed to house all branches of the Mississippi state government. Currently, only the Legislature and the executive branches are contained in the capitol. The judicial branch is housed in the Gartin Justice Building across High Street. In the Rotunda, walls are Italian white marble with a base of New York jet black marble. Eight big columns are art marble called scagliola. The dome interior contains 750 lights which illuminate the blind-folded lady representing &amp;quot;Blind Justice&amp;quot; and four scenes: two Indians, a Spanish explorer and a Confederate general. Balustrades are cast iron and original to the building. An eight foot tall, fifteen foot wide eagle soars above the dome, made of solid copper and gilded with gold leaf. In 1979, the capitol building underwent a complete renovation, which cost $19 million. The renovation remained true to the original building and strived to maintain the original design when at all possible. It was completed in 1983. The Hall of Governors is located on the first floor. Portraits of Mississippi's governors since the creation of the Mississippi Territory in 1798 are on display. The State Library and the Supreme Court chambers, now both committee meeting rooms, are located on the second floor. The Legislature is housed on the third floor, along with the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House's offices.

In the center of the dome is a green circle of printing that says, &amp;quot;The people's government made for the people by the people and answerable to the people.&amp;quot; An Indian Princess on six wooden panels is Theresa Whitecloud, a full blooded Choctaw Indian Princess, who died in 1970. The Chamber desks were replaced in the 1940s. The House of Representatives Chamber houses 122 members and the Speaker of the House is the presiding officer. The Chamber dome is the original Bohemian stained glass with another dome on top for protection of the stained glass. Desks are the originals from 1903. The Mississippi Coat of Arms is at the top of each arch. The walls are art marble and their base is Belgium black marble. One of the 53 replicas of the original Liberty Bell, as well as a statue erected in memory of the ladies, mothers, sisters, wives and daughters of the Confederate soldiers is located on the capitol grounds.

<photo  date_taken="2009-09-10 07:42:31" description="The Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson, Mississippi is the state capitol building of the U.S. state of Mississippi, housing the Mississippi Legislature. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 and designated a Mississippi Landmark in 1986. The current Mississippi State Capitol building, often called the &amp;quot;New Capitol,&amp;quot; is located in downtown Jackson and has been the home to Mississippi's state legislature since 1903. It is the third capitol building in Jackson. The building was erected on the site of the old state penitentiary and was designed by Theodore Link, an architect from St. Louis, Missouri. The building cost $1,093,641 dollars, which was paid by the Illinois Central Railroad via back taxes they owed the state. The capitol is 402 feet (123 m) long and 180 feet (55 m) to the top of the dome. The exterior is made up of Georgia granite, foundation concrete walls and bedford limestone. The Beaux-Arts architecture style building was designed to house all branches of the Mississippi state government. Currently, only the Legislature and the executive branches are contained in the capitol. The judicial branch is housed in the Gartin Justice Building across High Street. In the Rotunda, walls are Italian white marble with a base of New York jet black marble. Eight big columns are art marble called scagliola. The dome interior contains 750 lights which illuminate the blind-folded lady representing &amp;quot;Blind Justice&amp;quot; and four scenes: two Indians, a Spanish explorer and a Confederate general. Balustrades are cast iron and original to the building. An eight foot tall, fifteen foot wide eagle soars above the dome, made of solid copper and gilded with gold leaf. In 1979, the capitol building underwent a complete renovation, which cost $19 million. The renovation remained true to the original building and strived to maintain the original design when at all possible. It was completed in 1983. The Hall of Governors is located on the first floor. Portraits of Mississippi's governors since the creation of the Mississippi Territory in 1798 are on display. The State Library and the Supreme Court chambers, now both committee meeting rooms, are located on the second floor. The Legislature is housed on the third floor, along with the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House's offices. Public viewing balconies for both chambers are located on the fourth floor. The Senate Chamber houses 52 members and the Lt. Governor is the presiding officer. The Chamber is art marble with the base of Belgium black marble. Its columns are Breccia Violet with corinthian caps. Its Dome is Bohemian stained glass with another dome on top for protection. In the center of the dome is a green circle of printing that says, &amp;quot;The people's government made for the people by the people and answerable to the people.&amp;quot; An Indian Princess on six wooden panels is Theresa Whitecloud, a full blooded Choctaw Indian Princess, who died in 1970. The Chamber desks were replaced in the 1940s. The House of Representatives Chamber houses 122 members and the Speaker of the House is the presiding officer. The Chamber dome is the original Bohemian stained glass with another dome on top for protection of the stained glass. Desks are the originals from 1903. The Mississippi Coat of Arms is at the top of each arch. The walls are art marble and their base is Belgium black marble. One of the 53 replicas of the original Liberty Bell, as well as a statue erected in memory of the ladies, mothers, sisters, wives and daughters of the Confederate soldiers is located on the capitol grounds.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. --Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands. He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers. He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislature. He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states: For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world: For imposing taxes on us without our consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury: For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses: For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule in these colonies: For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments: For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare, is undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.

<photo  date_taken="2007-09-01 00:00:00" description="The centerpiece of Alexander H. Stephens State Historic park is Liberty Hall the home of Alexander Hamilton Stephens, a United States Congressman, Governor of Georgia, and Vice President of the Confederate States of America. Stephens bought the estate in 1845 and made his home here until his death in 1883. He once owned several thousand adjoining acres. The &amp;quot;Big House&amp;quot; has eight bedrooms - four on each level. It is now a National Historic Landmark and is maintained by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Behind the main house is a smaller building which contains many of Stephen's books and other personal items. He is said to have spent most of his time here after the War Between the States. During that time he wrote his classic two volume work: A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States: its causes, character, conduct and results; presented in a series of colloquies at Liberty Hall. Stephens was a constitutional scholar and authority who maintained vigoriously - and I believe correctly - that it was the Confederacy and not the Union which was the true defeneder of the Constitution of the United States. Some historians credit Stephens with popularizing the name &amp;quot;War Between the States.&amp;quot; The home is open for tours and I have personally taken the tour on a couple of occasions. The tourguides speak of Stephens as though they are old family friends - and perhaps they are - a few generations removed. Anyone with even a modicum of interest in history will find a visit here and the tour extremely interesting. Behind the Big House are other outbuildings that were a part of the old homestead. According to Margeret Mitchell, author of Gone with the Wind, this house was a prototype for Tara in her famous novel.

Stephens (1812-1883), former United States Congressman, Governor of Georgia, and Vice President of the Confederate States of America. In the hidden pictures I show the inscriptions on all four sides of the monument and they are well worth reading. If the man was only half as noble and good as the eloquent words on his monument attest, he was truly a great man. Stephens was not named for Alexander Hamilton, as many presume, but for Alexander Hamilton Webster, a Presbyterian minister and benefactor who helped Stephens obtain his education. In addition to his political accomplishments, Stephens was a constitutional scholar. He was the author of a classical book about the War for Southern Independence entitled: &amp;quot;A Constitutional View of the War Between the States.&amp;quot; which I mentioned in the earlier tip. The Constitution of the Confederate States of America was virtually the same as the United States Constitution with only a handful of improvements. For example, the first sentence of the preamble to the Constitution of the CSA inserts the phrase, &amp;quot;each State acting in its sovereign and independent character.&amp;quot; Also, the Confederate Constitution prohibited the foreign slave trade, which had been allowed under the original United States Constitution.

<photo  date_taken="2007-09-01 00:00:00" description="Just by glancing across the Crawfordville Cemetery I would reckon that more people lay interred here that the current population of Crawfordville. The property for the cemetery was given to Crawfordville, in 1873, by the town's favorite son, Alexander Hamilton Stephens. Ironically, he is not buried here, but lies just a hundred yards or so away in front of his home, Liberty Hall. the Crawfordville Baptist Church stands between the cemetery and Liberty Hall. Many of the graves here go back to the 19th century and it is a very interesting place for those who like to explore old graveyards. I'm such a person and have enjoyed reading the inscriptions on some of the tombstones and pondering the lives and fates of those whose final resting place is here." id="3047544699" latitude="33.558222" license="2" longitude="-82.894034" nbComments="0" rank="30" tags="crawfordville georgia taliaferrocounty" title="Crawfordville Cemetery" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3016/3047544699_978d806548_b.jpg" username="J.

It is on land that was surrounded by the Alexander H. Stephens estate and it predates both the town and the County.
