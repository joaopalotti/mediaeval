<photo  date_taken="2006-10-07 23:21:36" description="The Tower of Pisa is the bell tower of the Cathedral. Its construction began in the august of 1173 and continued (with two long interruptions) for about two hundred years, in full fidelity to the original project, whose architect is still uncertain. In the past it was widely believed that the inclination of the Tower was part of the project ever since its beginning, but now we know that it is not so. The Tower was designed to be &amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot; (and even if it did not lean it would still be one of the most remarkable bell towers in Europe), and started to incline during its construction. Both because of its inclination, and its beauty, from 1173 up to the present the Tower has been the object of very special attention. During its construction efforts were made to halt the incipient inclination through the use of special construction devices; later colums and other damaged parts were substituted in more than one occasion; today, interventions are being carried out within the sub-soil in order to significantly reduce the inclination and to make sure that Tower will have a long life. In all this story it is possible to find a meaningful constant, the &amp;quot;genetic code&amp;quot; of the Tower: its continual interaction with the soil on which it was built. Today's (1999) works for the safeguard and the conservation of the Tower with very advanced methodologies are designed to fully respect this constant." id="315412804" latitude="0" license="1" longitude="0" nbComments="10" rank="34" tags="tuscany italy mediterranean mediterraneancruise holiday pisa leaningtowerofpisa belltower architecture landmark cathedral 5photosaday city cityscape" title="The Leaning Tower of Pisa ~" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/118/315412804_497e5f8a86_b.jpg" username="**Mary**" views="5201" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-02-25 11:03:27" description="Fact fans - the tower was not all built at once, it was built in 3 stages over nearly two centuries. It was built to a certain height in the first stage and after many years it began to lean, and so when they came back much later to build the second stage they built it upright (at the time) by making one side of each floor higher than the other to compensate for the lean. Ditto for the 3rd stage. So not only does the tower lean as a whole, it is not actually straight in and of itself and so it would never be possible to get it to look like a normal building." id="5584877107" latitude="43.723292" license="1" longitude="10.397357" nbComments="0" rank="69" tags="italy pisa leaningtowerofpisa" title="Leaning Tower of Pisa" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5177/5584877107_65f6cd01b5_b.jpg" username="PGBrown1987" views="39" />

The architect had a family... probably three or four young kids...so told to the mayor &amp;quot;Well... of course I can do it! I was just trying to tell you the &amp;quot;might&amp;quot; eventually perhaps be some small problems...&amp;quot; and the construction begun. Since the first florr was clear that the tower was leaning... but still the mayor was saying &amp;quot;No... it is not leaning... stop to drink all that wione and you will se the tower is straight!!!!&amp;quot;. Arrived at the third floor the problem was undeniable. At that time there was the death penalty for architects whose building collapsed so one night our architect sadly packed all his things, wife and children and took to flight before the collapse of the tower ... that's why we do not know anything about him nowadays. The mayor was very angry and started to look for another architect to finish the tower but couldn't. He was walking the town asking for an architect but they all disappeared apart one that told the mayor he just become a snake eater. then it strated the war and the mayor had to spend his money in another way.

<photo  date_taken="2007-12-26 10:38:37" description="From &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;: The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italian: Torre pendente di Pisa) or simply The Tower of Pisa (La Torre di Pisa) is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa. It is situated behind the Cathedral and it is the third structure by time in Pisa's Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). Although intended to stand vertically, the tower began leaning to the southeast soon after the onset of construction in 1173 due to a poorly laid foundation and loose substrate that has allowed the foundation to shift direction. The height of the tower is 55.86 m (183.27 ft) from the ground on the lowest side and 56.70 m (186.02 ft) on the highest side. The width of the walls at the base is 4.09 m (13.42 ft) and at the top 2.48 m (8.14 ft). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 tonnes. The tower has 296 steps (the seventh floor has a different number of steps on the two sides, if you climb it on the north part you can count only 294 steps). The tower leans at an angle of 3.97 degrees. This means that the top of the tower is 3.9 meters from where it would stand if the tower were perfectly vertical. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=2316788313&quot;&gt;View On Black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/world/pool/tags/italy/&quot;&gt;Back to Italy&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/world/&quot;&gt;Visit the World&lt;/a&gt;" id="2316788313" latitude="43.723133" license="3" longitude="10.397363" nbComments="1" rank="134" tags="italia italy toscana tuscany pisa leaningtowerofpisa leaningtower leaning towerofpisa torrependentedipisa torrependente torre torredipisa pisacathedral campanile bell belltower unesco travel europe canon sd450 canonsd450 diamondclassphotographer flickrdiamond" title="The Famous Leaning Tower of Pisa" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2218/2316788313_fdfdba558a_b.jpg" username="wenzday01" views="2338" />

<photo  date_taken="2008-12-22 21:50:34" description="The Leaning Tower of Pisa is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa. It is situated behind the cathedral and is the third oldest structure in Pisa's Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square) after the cathedral and the baptistry. The Tower of Pisa was a work of art, performed in three stages over a period of about 177 years. Construction of the campanile began on August 9, 1173, a period of military success and prosperity. The first floor is surrounded by pillars with classical capitals, leaning against blind arches in white marble. The tower began to sink after construction progressed to the third floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-meter foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, because the Pisans were almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled. The seventh floor was completed in 1319. The bell-chamber was not finally added until 1372." id="3130369700" latitude="43.710458" license="1" longitude="10.398559" nbComments="12" rank="136" tags="architecture columns europe italy leaning pisa tower travel leaningtower film davidpham shapeshift davidphamsf" title="the leaning tower of pisa" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3293/3130369700_d2f21cf7e1_b.jpg" username="shapeshift" views="1637" />
