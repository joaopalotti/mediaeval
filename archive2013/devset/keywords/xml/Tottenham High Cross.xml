Warren Court, High Cross Road. &lt;/b&gt; ___________________________ &lt;b&gt;HIGH SOCIETY ?&lt;/b&gt; One reason given for the (thankfully abandoned) plans to build on the southern end of Down Lane Park was that the location was appropriate for eight-storey blocks because it already had such high blocks nearby. &lt;b&gt;Perhaps the Planners/Regeneration &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; think that local people go round with our eyes shut?&lt;/b&gt; To the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?t=h&amp;amp;hl=en-GB&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.590131,-0.0644&amp;amp;panoid=7dL7mD18ZunckUfR22FmEg&amp;amp;cbp=12,282.55,,0,1.63&amp;amp;ll=51.590053,-0.064314&amp;amp;spn=0.002433,0.004823&amp;amp;z=18&amp;amp;vpsrc=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;east of Down Lane Park&lt;/a&gt; the buildings on the Chesnut Estate are mostly two storeys, with some three and four storey blocks. To the south of Down Lane Park, it is true that Warren Court - at the centre of this photo - has nine storeys and a basement. But as you can also see, the flats opposite in Hale Gardens are mostly four-storeys. As are the flats in High Cross Road. With the exception of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?t=h&amp;amp;hl=en-GB&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=51.58827,-0.064749&amp;amp;spn=0.002213,0.004731&amp;amp;z=18&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.588913,-0.064419&amp;amp;panoid=ksJ9DhGJD60nHhvP_pZs6A&amp;amp;cbp=12,331.66,,0,-2.68&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;five-storey block&lt;/a&gt; with shops on the ground floor. There's another four storey building nearby - part of the hostel complex at 99 High Cross Road, between Monument Way and High Cross Road. Two years after I took this photo everyone can see the invasive, slab city going up to the East of Tottenham Hale Station. Despite its twee name of &amp;quot;Hale Village&amp;quot; we can see how out-of-place and out-of-scale it is. &lt;b&gt;Links&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; See the area for yourself by taking virtual stroll with &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=hale+road+n17&amp;amp;sll=51.500862,-0.123167&amp;amp;sspn=0.013678,0.027509&amp;amp;g=london&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Hale+Rd,+London+N17+9LB,+United+Kingdom&amp;amp;ll=51.588856,-0.065081&amp;amp;spn=0.002893,0.013754&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.588855,-0.065074&amp;amp;panoid=o88Z_prT9mIDiCoM6XtC6A&amp;amp;cbp=11,79.46,,0,-3.59&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google Street View&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/sets/72157608792751470/&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for my set of photos of 99 High Cross Road. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; View the four-storey building &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=monument+way+n17&amp;amp;sll=51.500862,-0.123167&amp;amp;sspn=0.013731,0.020385&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Monument+Way,+London+N17+9NX,+United+Kingdom&amp;amp;ll=51.589243,-0.066133&amp;amp;spn=0.002906,0.010192&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.589158,-0.066123&amp;amp;panoid=if9FrcnTmmonq_E0y4vDQQ&amp;amp;cbp=11,78.95,,0,-11.48&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;from Monument Way&lt;/a&gt; using Google Street View. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/noise/docs/urbandes/06highcrossroad.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Walter Mentheth Architects&lt;/a&gt; designed 99 High Cross Road. Their website describes the problem of &amp;quot;development adjacent to the extreme traffic noise of a main highway&amp;quot;. Their solution was to recycle the spoil from the demolished buildings to create a two-storey high &amp;quot;Environmental Noise Bund &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/1355567566/&quot;&gt;vegetated on a 65-degree slope&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; which &amp;quot;shelters the site from noise and pollution . . . .&amp;quot; Welbourne Primary School in High Cross Road, is also screened from noise and pollution by a bund - a mound. This was made during the construction of Monument Way - also using spoil from the construction work. Without this protection, it would suffer the same problems faced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/89945611@N00/3127102690/&quot;&gt;Earlsmead School&lt;/a&gt; in Broad Lane. What are the implications for air and noise pollution for future residential development on the north side of Monument Way? When we'll have even heavier two-way traffic. ════════════════════════════════════════════════════ &lt;b&gt;SPOT THE LEAK&lt;/b&gt; Observant Flickr visitors may have wondered about the large dark blob on the side of Warren Court.

<photo  date_taken="2008-11-07 17:05:48" description="&lt;b&gt;7 November 2008. Monument Way, Tottenham looking westward.&lt;/b&gt; Both ends of Monument Way are disfigured by huge illuminated billboards. The central section is a welcome stretch of grass verges, trees, bushes and brick wall. I have mixed feelings about illuminated advertising panels on bus stops. They are another way to clutter-up streets with ads. On the other hand they bring extra light to areas where people are standing and waiting - sometimes in isolated spots. From this angle and in this early evening light, the vertical yellow bars of Western Union's ad seemed to echo the colours of the distinctive block on the left. As does the sunset sky. The buildings are part of a hostel at 99 High Cross Road, designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/noise/docs/urbandes/06highcrossroad.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; Walter Menteth Architects&lt;/a&gt;.

The bank on the left of the photo is a green bund, built from spoil when the previous hostel was demolished. This shields hostel buildings from traffic noise and pollution.

Bus lane problems continue. Click the triangle on the video to see the hammering this manhole cover takes from bus wheels.&lt;/b&gt; Transport for London (TfL) maintains this part of High Road, Tottenham, London N17 - including the bus lane at the junction of High Road Tottenham and Monument Way N17. (It's next to the High Cross Monument.) From the video - and photo below - you can see that the road surface and a Thames Water manhole cover were damaged. On &lt;b&gt; 9 January 2008&lt;/b&gt; I had reported to Transport for London what looked like a subsiding manhole cover at this spot. The response by TfL was to add some tarmac. On &lt;b&gt;9 February 2008&lt;/b&gt; the problem seemed just as bad - as you can see from a few seconds of video &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/-LNg1NipV30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;posted on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. (I sent TfL the link.) Transport for London emailed me on &lt;b&gt;4 March 2008&lt;/b&gt;. They'd asked Thames Water: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;to carry out a permanent repair to their asset.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;On 8 May 2011&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/570117331/&quot;&gt;I reported to TfL&lt;/a&gt; that the roadway was again showing damage. On 9 June they emailed that &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot; . . . our Highways Operations Team for the area had carried out temporary repair works.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; And also that:: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;an order for a permanent repair was sent to Thames Water, as this is their responsibility as the asset owner.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; The temporary repair was done as promised. But by &lt;b&gt;9 July 2011&lt;/b&gt; the damage looked worse than before. (See photo below.) I again reported the problem to Transport for London. &lt;a href=&quot;URL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Click here to see my email&lt;/a&gt; and their reply, when it arrives. ___________________________________________ &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; Aerial view of &lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:5918808515&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;where this picture was taken.&lt;/a&gt;" id="5918808515" latitude="51.588873" license="5" longitude="-0.070364" nbComments="3" rank="8" tags="geo:lat=5158887333039497 geo:lon=007036410144428373 geotagged buslane tottenham haringey transportforlondon tfl monumentway highroadtottenham thameswater" title="High Cross - Damaged Bus Lane" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6132/5918808515_c6a2db9cf4_b.jpg" username="Alan Stanton" views="255" />

It makes a refreshing change from news of conferences and seminars &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; regeneration. Can you please tell me what plans are in place and funding bids underway to complete the remaining works on the access roadway - the area between the market stalls and the alley to Holcombe Road? When will these plans be available for public consultation? This includes building a raised crossing of Stoneleigh Road between Holcombe Road and the market. Funding was obtained, and a date set. But the work was postponed during construction of the new building. When will the crossing works start and when is the expected completion date? How will this work be co-ordinated with works on the roadway between Stoneleigh Road and the market stalls? At present this area remains more or less the last part of Stoneleigh Road not yet brought up to a minimum acceptable standard - i.e. it's much the same mess and muddle it has been for years. As we always realised, successful completion of the access roadway - including proper parking arrangements - is an essential component of the whole scheme. In my view, it is urgently needed if the workspace accommodation is to have a real prospect of success.

To illustrate the problem I've been taking photos. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/53921762@N00/sets/72157602536129402/&quot;&gt;These&lt;/a&gt; are from 19 October. Since then, things have improved a little as the barriers round the new building were removed. However, as you can see in my photo on 23 November, the basic problems remain. They will continue while this part of the project is unfinished. Can I also urge an imaginative look at the linked issue of parking - in collaboration, of course, with Highways and the Parking Service. At the moment it appears that the roadway adjoining the stalls in Holcombe Road is almost the only part of Stoneleigh Road where there is free parking. As a result, it seems this roadway is used by (among others): * Customers of the stalls and of other businesses nearby; * Staff of the stalls and other businesses. * Delivery vehicles Plainly, this short roadway cannot be seen in isolation from parking provision along the whole of Stoneleigh Road. Just as plainly, it's in nobody's interest to damage the business of either stallholders or traders on the High Road by making the restrictions and costs of parking too high. My own view is that a brief, extremely cheap period of &amp;quot;stop-and-collect&amp;quot; would serve everyone's interests - including income generation for the Council. I look forward to hearing from you." id="2120987896" latitude="51.592872" license="5" longitude="-0.068675" nbComments="0" rank="14" tags="holcomberoad stoneleighroad tottenham haringey haringeylawcentre badparking" title="High Road Access #12" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2386/2120987896_c7d0d75824_b.jpg" username="Alan Stanton" views="558" />

How far do parking charges deter potential customers from using shops on Tottenham High Road? &lt;/b&gt; This parking meter is one of several dozen along Stoneleigh Road close to High Road Tottenham. (It's &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; in the large &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/1493182936/&quot;&gt;Stoneleigh Road carparks&lt;/a&gt;.) Like other meters along this road, it accepts a minimum payment of 20 pence for which the motorist gets seven minutes. Some of which will be needed to walk back to open their car and display the ticket on the dashboard. Some Tottenham residents and traders have been meeting with local councillors, staff from Haringey Council, Transport for London, and other agencies to discuss ways of improving the High Road and nearby streets in the Bruce Grove/ Holcombe Market part of High Road Tottenham. Parking is a contentious issue here as in many other towns and cities. A number of residents and traders think carparking charges should be very low for short stay. I agree and think that parking spaces in Stoneleigh Road should be free for a brief period. By contrast, many supermarkets and shopping malls not located in traditional High Streets offer customers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/6908309815/in/set-72157629990114643/&quot;&gt;free parking&lt;/a&gt;. __________________________________________ &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; Aerial view of &lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:8167972209&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;where I took these photos.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/7149071563/&quot;&gt;Love Free Parking&lt;/a&gt; at the Brent Cross Shopping Mall. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; Barnet Blogger Mr Mustard &lt;a href=&quot;http://lbbspending.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/hopscotch-is-hopping-mad.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;backs Barnet traders&lt;/a&gt; who say that current high parking charges there are threatening their commercial survival." id="8167972209" latitude="51.592562" license="5" longitude="-0.068907" nbComments="2" rank="17" tags="geotagged geo:lat=5159256221060525 geo:lon=006890797928735992 parkingcharges parking parkticket stoneleighroad albertplace highroad tottenham haringey londonn17" title="Stoneleigh Road - Seven minutes parking for 20p" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8202/8167972209_e820963e9e_b.jpg" username="Alan Stanton" views="58" />

The video describes it as: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;a great central location in Zone 3&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;close to local Uni campuses&amp;quot;.&lt;/i&gt; Well, it's certainly in London Transport Zone 3. Though students will decide for themselves if 5 miles (8 km) from the city centre is a &amp;quot;central location&amp;quot;; and if their own University buildings are conveniently near. There are some shots of the interior of the building; of students' rooms; and on-site facilities. These include a laundry room, table football and table tennis; and a drinks dispensing machine which appears to levitate an orange can.

Should they rely on guesswork? Or depend on neat geometric schemes? Should perhaps everything be paved? The architects let the problem stand unsolved until the school had been in use throughout its first winter, during which they mapped the paths which users had made in the snow. The architects let users inform them where paths should go.&amp;quot; — &lt;/i&gt; Jane Jacobs.

This is one section of the new paving along more than a kilometre of the High Road in North Tottenham. I was with a local resident who uses a wheelchair. As the photo shows, there was gap in the road surface between the roadway and the edge of the tactile paving at the dropped kerb. This is a possible hazard for anyone with limited mobility; for an elderly person; and for a wheelchair user. Or perhaps someone pushing a baby buggy. I realise these pavement improvements can't be done without some inconvenience to the public. But can I please ask that T&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;L is pressed to complete these works as soon as possible; and &lt;b&gt;specifically to give priority where unfinished work may be hazardous.&lt;/b&gt; Can I ask that a check is made along the High Road where these works are underway - or have been done - to locate other possible hazards. &lt;b&gt;Can I also suggest that - if we don't do so already - &lt;i&gt;we find ways to involve people with disabilities in monitoring such projects&lt;/i&gt;, especially a large project like this. &lt;/b&gt;" id="2867436565" latitude="51.596751" license="5" longitude="-0.068407" nbComments="1" rank="26" tags="highroadtottenham tottenham haringey transportforlondon tfl londonn17" title="Hazard Repaired" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3166/2867436565_0af2077e7b_b.jpg" username="Alan Stanton" views="304" />
<photo  date_taken="2012-02-19 13:58:32" description="&lt;b&gt;19 February 2012. Free car park at Brent Cross Shopping mall.&lt;/b&gt; We needed a replacement door for a kitchen cupboard and thought Sunday afternoon would be a good time to go back to Brent Cross. We were wrong. Like us, other people were slowly circling round the carparks looking for a vacant bay. Both nationally and locally there's debate about how to prevent the further decline of traditional high street stores (= main street), in the face of competition from malls and megastores. With online shopping taking sales from both. Planners and policy-makers go to conferences and have serious lunches to discuss &lt;i&gt;place-making&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;place-shaping&lt;/i&gt;. Many residents tell local councils that the solution is the return of the major chain stores to the High Streets. While others seem to think the answer is old-fashioned independent stores. Perhaps supplemented by farmers’ markets and food grown on allotments. Plus booting-out the betting shops, of course. Sometimes I wonder how many people suggesting these strategies routinely buy stuff on Amazon; or order home deliveries of groceries from Tesco or Ocado. Meanwhile, tens (hundreds?) of thousands of Londoners take trains, buses, or cars to shopping malls such as Westfield, Bluewater, and Brent Cross. &lt;b&gt;The Portas Review&lt;/b&gt; In December 2011 the Coalition government published &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/p/11-1434-portas-review-future-of-high-streets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Portas Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - a report by Mary Portas with her recommendations about the crisis in our high streets and how to secure their future. She begins by setting out a basic fact&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; less than half of retail spending is in our high streets and this figure is falling. Nationally many shops stand empty. The big supermarket chains are increasing their share and expanding further into goods and services previously served by specialist stores – opticians, pharmacies and electrical goods, for example. I'm not a shopping person. I can only wear one pair of shoes at a time. When they finally wear out and start falling apart, if I have to try more than four pairs of new shoes, I leave the shop and put up with the old pair for another six months or so. But I do love cities and towns and bustling streets and alleys; shops with beautiful displays, arcades and markets. And people-watching. Especially people watching. Public streets, like public parks, are &lt;i&gt;commons&lt;/i&gt;. My hero in this is the writer and campaigner Jane Jacobs. In the 1960s when I first read her, it was like meeting a wise and delightful new friend whose book &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; took me with her into the streets of New York and Toronto which she loved and fought to save. And made me see my own London Town in a rich new light Mary Portas isn't Jane Jacobs. And primed by Jane – and by my knowledge of Tottenham, Wood Green and places in London and other cities I know – it’s not hard to see what's missing from Mary’s Report. But Mary Portas cares about cities and streets. And understands how they serve as lively social spaces – a way of strengthening social networks, as well as having an economic purpose. She quotes Jane Jacobs’ view that: &lt;i&gt;   “the sum of such casual public contact at the local level . . . is a feeling for the public    identity of people, a web of public respect and trust, and a resource in time of personal    or neighbourhood need.”&lt;/i&gt; ____________________________________ &lt;b&gt;Links&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; The panorama above is a stitched from two photos.

Portas insisted that she was not &amp;quot;pointing fingers of blame&amp;quot; at out-of-town retail. She was also refreshingly unsentimental about what most retail &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;customers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; actually seek out. &lt;i&gt;  &amp;quot;The fact is that the major supermarkets and malls have delivered highly convenient, needs-based retailing, which serves today’s consumers well. Sadly, the high streets didn’t adapt as quickly or as effectively. Now, they need to.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;. . . my report is not about nostalgia; nor is it a sentimental plea to nurture and protect small shopkeepers above all else.

On 7 May I took photos and a few seconds of video of a potential hazard in a bus lane on the red route in High Road, Tottenham, where a manhole cover seems damaged by the constant weight of bus wheels. You'll also see that TfL staff cannot view my photos and video on Flickr.com because they are &amp;quot;not authorised to view public blogs&amp;quot;. I reported the same Bus Lane problem in 2008 when work was done to remedy it. At that time TfL staff were able to view my Flickr pages and a video on YouTube. I thought you would be interested to know this, given that you recently launched the website LoveCleanLondon.org which has the huge advantage of letting Londoners send in photos and map references for dumping etc. If you would take a few seconds to view my Flickr page, you'll see that I use this for a similar purpose. It makes no sense whatever that TfL staff are banned from viewing photos and video which could help them do their jobs. I look forward to hearing from you." id="5701173319" latitude="51.588886" license="5" longitude="-0.070354" nbComments="6" rank="28" tags="buslane tottenham haringey thameswater transportforlondon tfl monumentway highroadtottenham borisjohnson mayoroflondon joannemccartney londonassemblymember peterhendy vernoneveritt socialmediapolicy departmentofjustice victoriaaustralia" title="Damaged Bus Lane - Update 10 May 2011" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2344/5701173319_0ed1005118_b.jpg" username="Alan Stanton" views="445" />
<photo  date_taken="2011-12-28 14:03:54" description="&lt;b&gt;28 December 2011. Zena and I were crossing the Thames on the Millennium footbridge. The photo shows a view downriver towards Southwark Bridge.&lt;/b&gt; I pointed my camera at the river and foreshore. The Shard makes a guest appearance, as it does in many London photos these days. Although in mine it blends into a grey, overcast, wintry day. The Shard is due for completion in June 2012. As that approaches, the range of opinions about the building appear more polarised. &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;It Belongs to Our Imaginations&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; An article by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/architecture/8896810/The-Shard-its-architects-view.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dominic Bradbury in The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; gives the view of its architect Renzo Piano, who sees it as a tapering spire. &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;The spire concept is, something disappears into the clouds – it belongs to our imaginations&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;, he says. &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;It's also about – and this may be a bit poetic – breathing fresh air. You don't go up only to show muscle. You can do that if you are stupid, but if you are not then you go up and look for fresh air to breathe. You cannot do that by taking possession of the sky with a big, aggressive building.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; Richard Rogers, Piano's friend and former business partner, is also quoted: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;The Shard is an extremely important addition to the skyline&amp;quot; . . . 'It is a landmark. The skyline is changing very fast and now we have the Shard going up at exactly the right point.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Looking Down on Poverty&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; Others disagree. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/dec/30/shard-of-glass-london&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Robert Booth in The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; notes Renzo Piano's spire analogy. But the title of his article is: &lt;b&gt;London's Shard: a 'tower of power and riches' looking down on poverty&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;. Booth points out that the major investor in the building is Qatar. &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Two of the apartments span two entire floors each and are expected to become London homes for members of the Qatari royal family. The Shard – 80% owned through the country's central bank – is now the jewel in the crown of the emirate's growing London estate,&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; Booth quotes critics of the project. including Nick Stanton, former LibDem leader of the local Southwark Borough Council, who said: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;There has been a failure of imagination&amp;quot;. . . &amp;quot;There should be something in this building that the community uses on a daily basis instead of just walking around it. There should be something like a library in it … one of the frustrations I had as leader was the inability to link a big project like this to local outcomes.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; Professor Tony Travers, director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics is quoted saying it is a &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;tower of power and riches&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; in a poor borough. &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;It points to the paradoxical nature of property development in cities such as London. In order to bring about transformation it is necessary to accept gentrification. It is inevitable the arrival of a sharp piece of global capitalism is an odd incursion into a borough that is still authentic old Victorian London.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; Booth reports that Renzo Piano disagrees. For him: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;This is not about money&amp;quot;. . .. &amp;quot;It is about surprise and joy. This is about the way cities should go. They should stop and we should not go beyond the green belt. If you do this by going vertical that sends a message about conserving land. The building is not about arrogance and power but about increasing the intensity of city life.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Is The Shard going up at exactly the right point?&lt;/b&gt; From the perspective of money - big money and smart money - the Shard may be in the &lt;i&gt;right place&lt;/i&gt;. Whether or not it's at the &lt;i&gt;right time&lt;/i&gt; for its investors will depend on the choices London makes - or are made for us by people with power. A vital question is whether London becomes further divided geographically by race and class. A tale of three cities with a rich core, well-to-do outer ring; and a poorer inner ring. _____________________________ &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; For swooping, dramatic and sometimes glowing photos of The Shard, see the Nick Wood and Hayes Davidson &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.futurelondon.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shard 2012 Project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; The issues raised by the supporters and critics of the Shard may offer useful lessons elsewhere in London. Especially as in poorer areas rebuilding and &amp;quot;regeneration&amp;quot; can be seen as part of the process of recovery - getting back to &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; - after the riots in August 2011.   A more interesting question is the potential impact of development on the social issues underlying the riots and helping to prevent riots in the future. Sadly, in Tottenham where we live, it's beginning to look as though &amp;quot;Regeneration and Planning&amp;quot; will simply be repeating the same mistakes as before, while hoping for better outcomes. A misguided plan at the best of times. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; Aerial view showing &lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:6620492857&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;where I took this photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; John Tusa interviewed Renzo Piano for BBC radio. The 45 minute programme was broadcast on 28 July 2004. Piano is well worth listening to. He comes across as charming, disarming and very persuasive. &lt;s&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/johntusainterview/ram/ajtrenzopiano.ram&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Click here for the audio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/s&gt; (See note below).

Sure it is.

<photo  date_taken="2007-01-02 09:58:55" description="Londres, Inglaterra London, England &lt;i&gt;Oxford Street is a major thoroughfare in London, England in the City of Westminster. With over 300 shops, it is Europe's busiest shopping street, as well as the most dense. The street derives its name from being part of the old London—Oxford Road which began at Newgate, City of London. Today the road forms part of the A40, although it is not signposted as this, like other roads in central London. It runs for approximately a mile and a half (two and a half kilometres) from Marble Arch at the north east corner of Hyde Park, through Oxford Circus to St Giles' Circus, at the intersection with Charing Cross Road and Tottenham Court Road. Eastwards, the road then becomes New Oxford Street until it runs into High Holborn. Oxford Street intersects with other London roads including Park Lane, New Bond Street and Regent Street. West of Marble Arch, Oxford Street becomes Bayswater Road. Then up and over Notting Hill and along Holland Park Avenue until it becomes the Uxbridge Road at Shepherd's Bush Roundabout. At Uxbridge it becomes the Oxford – London Road again, all the way to Oxford, save for some short sections where it has adopted a local name. The street follows the route of a Roman road, the via Trinobantina, which linked Hampshire with Colchester and became one of the major routes in and out of the city. Between the 12th century and 1782 it was variously known as Tyburn Road (after the River Tyburn that ran just to the south of it, and now flows underneath it), Uxbridge Road, Worcester Road and Oxford Road. Note: To-day the name Uxbridge Road still exists for the portion of the London—Oxford Road between Shepherds Bush and Uxbridge itself. It became notorious as the route taken by prisoners on their final journey from Newgate Prison to the gallows at Tyburn near Marble Arch. By about 1729, the road had become known as Oxford Street. In the late 18th century, many of the surrounding fields were purchased by the Earl of Oxford, and the area was developed. It became popular with entertainers including tiger-baiters and masquerades, and for entertainment buildings such as the Pantheon. During the 19th century, the area became known for its shops.

It is part of the green set together with Regent Street and Bond Street. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Street&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;" id="2510457104" latitude="51.513737" license="3" longitude="-0.155997" nbComments="3" rank="35" tags="londres london inglaterra england europa europe 2007 sony h2 inverno winter oxfordstreet rua street uk reinounido unitedkingdom grãbretanha greatbritain gb geotagged" title="McDonald's na Oxford Street / McDonald's at Oxford Street" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2130/2510457104_c599ea372d_b.jpg" username="Marcio Cabral de Moura" views="4849" />
<photo  date_taken="2012-06-17 18:33:35" description="&lt;i&gt;Oxford Street é uma importante avenida na área de Westminster, em Londres, Inglaterra. Com mais de 300 lojas, é a rua comercial mais movimentada de toda a Europa. Seu nome é derivado da rodovia que liga Londres a Oxford que começa em Newgate, na Cidade de Londres. Hoje a rua é parte da rodovia A40, embora não seja sinalizada como tal, como diversas outras ruas centrais de Londres. Se estende por cerca de 2.5 quilometros (1.5 milhas) desde Marble Arch, na porção nordeste do Hyde Park, passando pelo Oxford Circus e St Giles' Circus na interseção da Charing Cross Road com a Tottenham Court Road. A partir deste ponto e em direção leste, a rua torna-se a New Oxford Street que estende-se até High Holborn. A Oxford Street intersecta outras importantes ruas de Londres, incluindo Park Lane, New Bond Street e Regent Street. A Oeste de Marble Arch, a Oxford Street transforma-se na Bayswater Road. Passando por Notting Hill, ganha o nome de Holland Park Avenue até transformar-se na Uxbridge Road no contorno no início do bairro de Shepherd's Bush. No bairro de Uxbridge esta avenida torna-se a estrada Londres - Oxford novamente até à cidade de Oxford, exceto por algumas pequenas porções em que recebe um nome local.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipédia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Oxford Street is a major thoroughfare in the City of Westminster in the West End of London, United Kingdom. It is Europe's busiest shopping street, and as of 2011 had approximately 300 shops. The street was formerly part of the London-Oxford road which began at Newgate, City of London, and was known as the Oxford Road. Today it forms part of the A40 trunk road, although like many roads in central London which are no longer through routes it is not signposted with the road number. Roughly halfway along Oxford Street is Oxford Circus, a busy intersection with Regent Street. A diagonal crossing at Oxford Circus opened in 2009, currently the only one of its kind in central London. Common sights on Oxford Street include preachers (such as Philip Howard) and political demonstrations (such as the 2001 May Day protests).&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;" id="7538504280" latitude="51.513469" license="3" longitude="-0.158025" nbComments="0" rank="36" tags="londres london 2012 summer verão rua street oxford double deck bus red vermelho ônibus bandeira flag gente people sinal traffic light" title="Oxford Street" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8425/7538504280_a6d650a69c_b.jpg" username="Marcio Cabral de Moura" views="164" />

Several years ago there was an intermittent problem with the build-up of litter and weeds inside the fenced area around the Monument. This was eventually tackled around 2006, with a reliable and regular litter and weed clearance scheduled. I have the impression that things have slipped a bit since the start of the Veolia contract. Can you please arrange to check that this area is included in the cleaning/weeding schedules and that cleaners have the keys needed to get into the fenced area. Currently the problem is a very minor one. I want to make sure it doesn't get bigger.

I was checking to see if action had been taken on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/7116274531/&quot;&gt;small flood in Tottenham High Road&lt;/a&gt; - which I reported a few days earlier on 25 April.&lt;/b&gt; With my shoes and trousers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/6979453668/&quot;&gt;thoroughly soaked&lt;/a&gt; by the wash from a passing &lt;s&gt;vaporetto&lt;/s&gt; bus, I decided to try a possible DIY solution. I learned about it many years ago from Peter Norton, a former Director of Haringey Environmental Services. At the time, I'd had a panicked phonecall from a Tottenham resident. London was then having continuous heavy rain with some flash flooding. The resident told me that drain gullies in his street were blocked and a large pool of water was steadily rising. It had crossed the pavement and was threatening his home. I'd phoned Mr Norton who told me - not surprisingly - that contractors with the right equipment were like gold dust across the capital. Also that flooded roads were blocking traffic. He suggested trying an emergency quick-fix. The resident could push a pole down the drain and wiggle it around. That might dislodge some of the blockage. I passed on Peter Norton's advice - which worked. So on 29 April I 2012 I borrowed a pole from T.G.B. - the grocery store on the right of the photo. Scraping it along the roadway I located the gully, lowered the pole and twisted it round. No obvious change. I don't have Peter Norton's magic. _______________________________ &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:6979459280&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See where this picture was taken.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; Tottenham Gida Bazaar Ltd - 422-424 High Road, Tottenham, London N17 9JB.

It's a large private Care Home bounded by Harold Road, Rangemoor Road and Herbert Road, in Tottenham, London N15. &lt;/b&gt; The photo shows the western end of the building in Rangemoor Road, looking south. It extends onto a small parcel of land which used to be a pocket-park, owned by Haringey Council. (The area hatched blue on the map inset. To match the photo, I've put south at the top.) The pocket-park was quite small - about 0.06 hectares. It had grassed mounds, a few trees, shrubs, a short walkway and some benches. It suddenly vanished after the land was sold by the Council to the developers &lt;i&gt;Precious Homes&lt;/i&gt; on 22 September 2004. To the dismay of many local residents and Governors of the nearby Earlsmead Primary School. (At the time, including me). I asked how this stupid error had been made. Haringey’s Property Services team emailed me explaining that: &lt;i&gt;“The site has never been known or referred to as a park of any type.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; They wrote that Housing - the “Holding Service” – &lt;i&gt;had declared the land surplus to requirements”&lt;/i&gt;, saying that: &lt;i&gt;“the site continually suffered from frequent illegal fly-tipping and was a burden on their budget in respect of regular clean-up costs”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;“A disposal of the strip of land was consequently regarded as a proactive and practical contribution to the Council's Better Haringey campaign; through the elimination of a problem site via development, this would ultimately contribute to the improvement of the fabric of the Borough.”&lt;/i&gt; I'd walked past this piece of land many times, and while it wasn't a park in a formal sense, it was very plainly and obviously &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;a small area of green&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which was maintained as such. Anyone who had taken the trouble to walk down Rangemoor Road would have realised this in about two seconds. Puzzled, I asked Haringey Parks Service. They sent me the &lt;b&gt;maintenance schedule&lt;/b&gt; they used to look after what their staff clearly did not regard as a piece of waste ground. Sure, the site may have suffered from dumping and was therefore a &amp;quot;burden&amp;quot; on the budget. But if local councils sold off every piece of land that got dumped on, there would be no parks, greens, pavements, alleyways, or even streets left. ════════════════════════════════════════ &lt;b&gt;About Priscilla Wakefield&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.precious-homes.co.uk/priscillawakefield.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Precious Homes&lt;/a&gt; website &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Priscilla Wakefield House is a purpose built residential home specifically designed to meet the needs of the elderly and also offers care for other specialisms such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease, and for young physically disabled people.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; As you may have spotted from the map there's a Wakefield Road nearby. So what has this care home got to do with Priscilla Wakefield [1750-1832] who was born in Tottenham and whose home was some 500 metres (a-third-of-a-mile) from Rangemoor Road? The answer? Nothing whatever. Her name has simply been used. Perhaps the aim is to add a historical patina to a new business in a new building. Or perhaps it's an attempt at virtue-by-association? Because Priscilla Wakefield was a remarkable person. She belonged to Tottenham's Quaker (Friends) community. In between caring for her family - bearing and sometimes burying her own children; and writing books for children and young people, she was involved in a range of social reforms and causes. These included anti-slavery; girls' education; and setting up a local savings bank in Tottenham. ___________________________________________ &lt;b&gt;Links&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; There's some brief information about Priscilla Wakefield on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Docklands/Whats-on/Galleries/LSS/Map/Resistance/People/102.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Museum of Docklands website&lt;/a&gt; noting her support for the anti-slavery campaign and for boycotting slave-produced sugar, cotton and tobacco. It says her family home was on the site of the present High Cross Church.

<photo  date_taken="2012-02-07 11:57:37" description="&lt;b&gt;7 February 2012. Zena and I had just left the launch event of the Report by the &amp;quot;Citizen's Inquiry&amp;quot; into the Tottenham Riots. It was held at the former Tottenham Town Hall. &lt;/b&gt; Anyone who cares about Tottenham would agree with the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;aim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of one of the recommendations in the Report. That we should all work together: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;to keep the streets tidy by reporting problem areas&amp;quot;.&lt;/i&gt; (Inquiry Report p.23.) Unfortunately a well-intentioned aspiration is not a programme for action. And no programme is likely to succeed unless it begins to understand the causes and nature of the problems. On the same page, the Inquiry Report urges Haringey Council to increase &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;funding for enforcement around dumping&amp;quot;.&lt;/i&gt; Not something any sensible person would disagree with, surely? Except that staff working on enforcement against dumping - or anything else - are workmen worthy of their hire. In other words they need paying. So I wondered whether the Inquiry members had even begun to grasp the sheer scale of Central Government cuts on Haringey. And what this meant for enforcement and many other services. &lt;b&gt;Blue Sky Up Above&lt;/b&gt; But anyway, there we were, 100 metres from the steps of the former Tottenham Town Hall. A beautiful blue sky overhead; and underfoot crisp white snow on Tottenham Green. With mattresses and bedbases dumped on the pavement nearby. In fact, even more dumping than appeared at first glance. (Please scroll down.) So did we report it and help keep Tottenham tidy? We did. In fact we spoke to staff from Haringey Enforcement and Veolia who happened to be close by, looking into problems near the High Cross Monument. Would these dumped beds get cleared quickly? Almost certainly. Will this make a longer-term difference? Yes. It will probably &lt;i&gt;encourage more dumping&lt;/i&gt;. Why is this? I'd would have explained it to the Inquiry if they'd asked me. Although it would have taken a bit longer than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/6415328169/in/set-72157629229225641/&quot;&gt;three minutes&lt;/a&gt; they allowed people. And of course it's only one of dozens of topics they include in the report. I'm sorry to say that some of the other recommendations in the report are as superficial and vacuous. ____________________________________ &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/3152449184/&quot;&gt;Here is one explanation&lt;/a&gt; why more frequent reporting and clearance of dumped rubbish &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;by itself&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is likely to have the unintended consequence of increasing dumping. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; About the radio panel game &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_a_Minute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Just a Minute&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; Aerial view of &lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:6843869571&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; where I took these photos&lt;/a&gt;." id="6843869571" latitude="51.588126" license="5" longitude="-0.07224" nbComments="1" rank="47" tags="geo:lat=5158812687860881 geo:lon=007224015028134545 geotagged tottenhamgreen townhallapproachroad philiplane tottenham haringey londonn17 mattress bed dumping garbage rubbish flytipping detritus waste" title="Mattresses in the Snow" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7189/6843869571_96743ea52e_b.jpg" username="Alan Stanton" views="202" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-05-26 17:49:50" description="&lt;b&gt;From time to time in Wood Green, observant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/3588641751/&quot;&gt;parkaeologists&lt;/a&gt; spot traces of a bygone era.&lt;/b&gt; If you look carefully at these photos you can make out the faded criss-cross pattern of a yellow box junction. It was painted across the &lt;s&gt;King's highway in medieval times to tax passing peasant carts&lt;/s&gt; roadway to let buses enter and leave the Arriva garage. As you see it has been replaced by white lines and KEEP CLEAR signs painted on the road. Was this yellow box junction &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;unlawful&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - just like the two outside the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/2333534320/&quot;&gt;Arriva Bus Garage&lt;/a&gt; in Philip Lane? Haringey claimed the Wood Green box junction complied with the statutory regulations. Even though, like those in Tottenham - it was not at &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;at the junction of two or more roads&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;, but at the entrance to a privately owned garage. Do the white 'Keep Clear' signs work without needing cameras, fines and wardens? And if they do, was the previous yellow box unnecessary? You'd need to ask Arriva bus drivers. But hey, the yellow box sure collected piles of &lt;s&gt;groats from the peasants in their carts&lt;/s&gt; cash for Haringey's Parking Account. __________________________ &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?t=h&amp;amp;hl=en-GB&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=51.598008,-0.110585&amp;amp;spn=0.001106,0.002366&amp;amp;z=19&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.597795,-0.110418&amp;amp;panoid=d3Hw2bhIVVFPov4o5-z28g&amp;amp;cbp=12,338.21,,0,9.05&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google Street View&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;§&lt;/b&gt; More Wood Green &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/3588641751/&quot;&gt;parkaeology in Gathorne Road&lt;/a&gt;." id="5445568497" latitude="51.598052" license="5" longitude="-0.110596" nbComments="2" rank="51" tags="geo:lat=5159805209910255 geo:lon=011059624952507452 geotagged parkaeology yellowboxjunction arrivagarage keepclear highroad woodgreen haringey londonn22 potsofcash" title="Garage Parkaeology" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4141/5445568497_c3e14b43a9_b.jpg" username="Alan Stanton" views="204" />
<photo  date_taken="2010-05-24 02:13:15" description="At the foot of the contra-flow bus lane from the High Cross. Bicycles aren't officially permitted down here, but the alternative is a half-mile detour round Monument Way, Tottenham Hale and Broad Lane - all feature three lanes of fast moving traffic, but in the case of Broad Lane the three lanes are a very tight squeeze with sharp bends, opening out into four lanes of lane-changing traffic. I've had more near misses than I can remember on that stretch of road. Faced with that prospect, the bus lane rule is one I routinely break without apology. TfL intend to start ripping up the old gyratory system in the next 12 months to re-establish two-way street layouts - the end product should do away with this headache." id="4633577801" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="6" rank="52" tags="" title="Seven Sisters" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4063/4633577801_4bbcd9cfa8_b.jpg" username="Nicobobinus" views="177" />
